AB  - Thermal sprayed metal coatings are used in many industrial applications, and characterizing the structure and performance of these materials is vital to understanding their behavior in the field. X-ray computed tomography (CT) enables volumetric, nondestructive imaging of these materials, but precise segmentation of this grayscale image data into discrete material phases is necessary to calculate quantities of interest related to material structure. In this work, we present a methodology to automate the CT segmentation process as well as quantify uncertainty in segmentations via deep learning. Neural networks (NNs) have been shown to excel at segmentation tasks; however, memory constraints, class imbalance, and lack of sufficient training data often prohibit their deployment in high resolution volumetric domains. Our 3D convolutional NN implementation mitigates these challenges and accurately segments full resolution CT scans of thermal sprayed materials with maps of uncertainty that conservatively bound the predicted geometry. These bounds are propagated through calculations of material properties such as porosity that may provide an understanding of anticipated behavior in the field.

AB  - Many biological applications require the segmentation of cell bodies, membranes and nuclei from microscopy images. Deep learning has enabled great progress on this problem, but current methods are specialized for images that have large training datasets. Here we introduce a generalist, deep learning-based segmentation method called Cellpose, which can precisely segment cells from a wide range of image types and does not require model retraining or parameter adjustments. Cellpose was trained on a new dataset of highly varied images of cells, containing over 70,000 segmented objects. We also demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) extension of Cellpose that reuses the two-dimensional (2D) model and does not require 3D-labeled data. To support community contributions to the training data, we developed software for manual labeling and for curation of the automated results. Periodically retraining the model on the community-contributed data will ensure that Cellpose improves constantly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Literature presents limited information on histological subtypes and their association with other factors influencing the survival of melanoma patients. To explore the risk of death due to melanoma associated with histological subtypes, this retrospective study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (SEER) data from 1998 to 2019.
METHODS: A total of 27,532 patients consisting of 15,527 males and 12,005 females. The Hypertabastic Accelerated Failure Time model was used to analyze the impact of histology on the survival of patients with cutaneous or mucosal melanoma.
RESULTS: The median survival time (MST) for cutaneous patients was 149 months, whereas those diagnosed with mucosal melanoma was 34 months. Nodular melanoma had a hazard ratio of 3.40 [95% CI: (2.94, 3.94)] compared to lentigo maligna melanoma. Across all histological subtypes, females had a longer MST, when compared to males. The hazard ratio (HR) of distant to localized melanoma was 9.56 [95% CI: (7.58, 12.07)].
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of patients' histological subtypes and their hazard assessment would enable clinicians and healthcare providers to perform personalized treatment, resulting in a lower risk of complication and higher survivability of melanoma patients. Significant factors were stage of the disease, age, histology, sex, and income. Focus should be placed on high-risk populations with severe and aggressive histological subtypes. Programs that emphasize preventive measures such as awareness, education, and early screening could reduce risk.

AB  - Finding the best technique to identify BRAF mutations with a high sensitivity and specificity is mandatory for accurate patient selection for target therapy. BRAF mutation frequency ranges from 40 to 60% depending on melanoma clinical characteristics and detection technique used.Intertumoral heterogeneity could lead to misinterpretation of BRAF mutational status; this is especially important if testing is performed on primary specimens, when metastatic lesions are unavailable.Aim of this study was to identify the best combination of methods for detecting BRAF mutations (among peptide nucleic acid - PNA-clamping real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and capillary sequencing) and investigate BRAF mutation heterogeneity in a series of 100 primary melanomas and a subset of 25 matched metastatic samples.Overall, we obtained a BRAF mutation frequency of 62%, based on the combination of at least two techniques. Concordance between mutation status in primary and metastatic tumor was good but not complete (67%), when agreement of at least two techniques were considered. Next generation sequencing was used to quantify the threshold of detected mutant alleles in discordant samples. Combining different methods excludes that the observed heterogeneity is technique-based. We propose an algorithm for BRAF mutation testing based on agreement between immunohistochemistry and PNA; a third molecular method could be added in case of discordance of the results. Testing the primary tumor when the metastatic sample is unavailable is a good option if at least two methods of detection are used, however the presence of intertumoral heterogeneity or the occurrence of additional primaries should be carefully considered.

AB  - Melanoma develops as a result of several genetic alterations, with UV radiation often acting as a mutagenic risk factor. Deep knowledge of the molecular signaling pathways of different types of melanoma allows better characterization and provides tools for the development of therapies based on the intervention of signals promoted by these cascades. The latest World Health Organization classification acknowledged the specific genetic drivers leading to melanoma and classifies melanocytic lesions into nine distinct categories according to the associate cumulative sun damage (CSD), which correlates with the molecular alterations of tumors. The largest groups are melanomas associated with low-CSD or superficial spreading melanomas, characterized by frequent presentation of the BRAFV600 mutation. High-CSD melanomas include lentigo maligna type and desmoplastic melanomas, which often have a high mutation burden and can harbor NRAS, BRAFnon-V600E, or NF1 mutations. Non-CSD-associated melanomas encompass acral and mucosal melanomas that usually do not show BRAF, NRAS, or NF1 mutations (triple wild-type), but in a subset may have KIT or SF3B1 mutations. To improve survival, these driver alterations can be treated with targeted therapy achieving significant antitumor activity. In recent years, relevant improvement in the prognosis and survival of patients with melanoma has been achieved, since the introduction of BRAF/MEK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this review, we describe the current knowledge of molecular pathways and discuss current and potential therapeutic targets in melanoma, focusing on their clinical relevance of development.

AB  - We present ilastik, an easy-to-use interactive tool that brings machine-learning-based (bio)image analysis to end users without substantial computational expertise. It contains pre-defined workflows for image segmentation, object classification, counting and tracking. Users adapt the workflows to the problem at hand by interactively providing sparse training annotations for a nonlinear classifier. ilastik can process data in up to five dimensions (3D, time and number of channels). Its computational back end runs operations on-demand wherever possible, allowing for interactive prediction on data larger than RAM. Once the classifiers are trained, ilastik workflows can be applied to new data from the command line without further user interaction. We describe all ilastik workflows in detail, including three case studies and a discussion on the expected performance.

AB  - We have studied the three-dimensional (3D) cytoarchitecture of the human hippocampus in neuropathologically healthy and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) individuals, based on phase-contrast X-ray computed tomography of postmortem human tissue punch biopsies. In view of recent findings suggesting a nuclear origin of AD, we target in particular the nuclear structure of the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Tissue samples of 20 individuals were scanned and evaluated using a highly automated approach of measurement and analysis, combining multiscale recordings, optimized phase retrieval, segmentation by machine learning, representation of structural properties in a feature space, and classification based on the theory of optimal transport. Accordingly, we find that the prototypical transformation between a structure representing healthy granule cells and the pathological state involves a decrease in the volume of granule cell nuclei, as well as an increase in the electron density and its spatial heterogeneity. The latter can be explained by a higher ratio of heterochromatin to euchromatin. Similarly, many other structural properties can be derived from the data, reflecting both the natural polydispersity of the hippocampal cytoarchitecture between different individuals in the physiological context and the structural effects associated with AD pathology.

T2  - Journal of Synchrotron Radiation
AB  - A computer program named ANKAphase is presented that processes X-ray inline phase-contrast radiographs by reconstructing the projected thickness of the object(s) imaged. The program uses a single-distance non-iterative phase-retrieval algorithm described by David Paganin et al. [(2002), J. Microsc. 206, 33‚Äì40]. Allowing for non-negligible absorption in the sample, this method is strictly valid only for monochromatic illumination and single-material objects but tolerates deviations from these conditions, especially polychromaticity. ANKAphase is designed to be applied to tomography data (although it does not perform tomographic reconstruction itself). It can process series of images and perform flat-field and dark-field correction. Written in Java, ANKAphase has an intuitive graphical user interface and can be run either as a stand-alone application or as a plugin to ImageJ, a widely used scientific image-processing program. A description of ANKAphase is given and example applications are shown.

AB  - Formalin fixation and paraffin embedding of post mortem tissue specimens is widely used for high-resolution neuroimaging with both conventional and X-ray virtual histology. Exchange of embedding solutions generates non-uniform brain shrinkage and changes relative tissue densities. We used synchrotron radiation-based X-ray micro computed tomography to visualize the embedding process for a single mouse brain. Non-rigid registration was employed to determine the volumetric strain fields and to track the X-ray absorption changes of corresponding features. This allows for a correction of the observed microanatomy to improve the anatomical context. Through embedding, the entire brain shrinks to around 40% of its volume in formalin. Shrinkage is non-uniform and varies over anatomical regions and the distance to external surfaces.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer worldwide. Diagnosing breast cancer relies on clinical examination, imaging and biopsy. A core-needle biopsy enables a morphological and biochemical characterization of the cancer and is considered the gold standard for breast cancer diagnosis. A histopathological examination uses high-resolution microscopes with outstanding contrast in the 2D plane, but the spatial resolution in the third, Z-direction, is reduced. In the present paper, we propose two high-resolution table-top systems for phase-contrast X-ray tomography of soft-tissue samples. The first system implements a classical Talbot‚ÄìLau interferometer and allows to perform ex-vivo imaging of human breast samples with a voxel size of 5.57¬†Œºm. The second system with a comparable voxel size relies on a Sigray MAAST X-ray source with structured anode. For the first time, we demonstrate the applicability of the latter to perform X-ray imaging of human breast specimens with ductal carcinoma in-situ. We assessed image quality of both setups and compared it to histology. We showed that both setups made it possible to target internal features of breast specimens with better resolution and contrast than previously achieved, demonstrating that grating-based phase-contrast X-ray CT could be a complementary tool for clinical histopathology.

AB  - The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is an intracellular pathway activated in response to progrowth signaling, such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and other kinases. Abnormal activation of PI3K has long been recognized as one of the main oncogenic drivers in breast cancer, including HER2-positive (HER2+) subtype. Somatic activating mutations in the gene encoding PI3K alpha catalytic subunit (PIK3CA) are present in approximately 30% of early-stage HER2+ tumors and drive therapeutic resistance to multiple HER2-targeted agents. Here, we review currently available agents targeting PI3K, discuss their potential role in HER2+ breast cancer, and provide an overview of ongoing trials of PI3K inhibitors in HER2+ disease. Additionally, we review the landscape of PIK3CA mutational testing and highlight the gaps in knowledge that could present potential barriers in the effective application of PI3K inhibitors for treatment of HER2+ breast cancer.

AB  - PIK3CA mutation frequency varies among breast cancer (BC) subtypes. Recent evidence suggests combination therapy with the PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki) alpelisib and endocrine therapy (ET) improves response rates and progression-free survival (PFS) in PIK3CA-mutant, hormone receptor positive (HR+) BC versus ET alone; thus, better understanding the clinical and epidemiologic elements of these mutations is warranted. This systematic review characterizes the PIK3CA mutation epidemiology, type of testing approaches (e.g., liquid or tissue tumor biopsy), and stability/concordance (e.g., consistency in results by liquid versus solid tumor sample, by the same method over time) in patients with HR+/HER2- advanced (locally unresectable) or metastatic disease (HR+/HER2- mBC) and explores performance (e.g., pairwise concordance, sensitivity, specificity, or predictive value) of respective mutation findings. A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and select conference abstracts (i.e., AACR, ASCO, SABCS, ECCO, and ESMO conferences between 2014 and 2017) identified 39 studies of patients with HR+, HER2- mBC. The median prevalence of PIK3CA mutation was 36% (range: 13.3% to 61.5%); identified testing approaches more commonly used tissue over liquid biopsies and primarily utilized next-generation sequencing (NGS), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or Sanger sequencing. There was concordance and stability between tissues (range: 70.4% to 94%) based on limited data. Given the clinical benefit of the PI3Ki alpelisib in patients with PIK3CA mutant HR+/HER2- mBC, determination of tumor PIK3CA mutation status is of importance in managing patients with HR+/HER2- mBC. Prevalence of this mutation and utility of test methodologies likely warrants PIK3CA mutation testing in all patients with this breast cancer subtype via definitive assessment of PIK3CA mutational status.

AB  - Historically, micro-computed tomography (ŒºCT) has been considered unsuitable for histologic analysis of unstained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded soft tissue biopsy specimens because of a lack of image contrast between the tissue and the paraffin. However, we recently demonstrated that ŒºCT can successfully resolve microstructural detail in routinely prepared tissue specimens. Herein, we illustrate how ŒºCT imaging of standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens can be seamlessly integrated into conventional histology workflows, enabling nondestructive three-dimensional (3D) X-ray histology, the use and benefits of which we showcase for the exemplar of human lung biopsy specimens. This technology advancement was achieved through manufacturing a first-of-kind ŒºCT scanner for X-ray histology and developing optimized imaging protocols, which do not require any additional sample preparation. 3D X-ray histology allows for nondestructive 3D imaging of tissue microstructure, resolving structural connectivity and heterogeneity of complex tissue networks, such as the vascular network or the respiratory tract. We also demonstrate that 3D X-ray histology can yield consistent and reproducible image quality, enabling quantitative assessment of a tissue's 3D microstructures, which is inaccessible to conventional two-dimensional histology. Being nondestructive, the technique does not interfere with histology workflows, permitting subsequent tissue characterization by means of conventional light microscopy‚Äìbased histology, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. 3D X-ray histology can be readily applied to a plethora of archival materials, yielding unprecedented opportunities in diagnosis and research of disease.

AB  - Microfocus CT (micro-CT) has traditionally been used in industry and preclinical studies, although it may find new applicability in the routine clinical setting. It can provide high-resolution three-dimensional digital imaging data sets to the same level of detail as microscopic examination without the need for tissue dissection. Micro-CT is already enabling non-invasive detailed internal assessment of various tissue specimens, particularly in breast imaging and early gestational fetal autopsy, not previously possible from more conventional modalities such as MRI or CT. In this review, we discuss the technical aspects behind micro-CT image acquisition, how early work with small animal studies have informed our knowledge of human disease and the imaging performed so far on human tissue specimens. We conclude with potential future clinical applications of this novel and emerging technique.

AB  - Here, we describe a workflow for high‚Äêdetail microCT imaging of formalin‚Äêfixed and paraffin‚Äêembedded (FFPE) equine embryos recovered on Day 34 of pregnancy (E34), a period just before placenta formation. The presented imaging methods are suitable for large animals' embryos with intention to study morphological and developmental aspects, but more generally can be adopted for all kinds of FFPE tissue specimens. Microscopic 3D imaging techniques such as microCT are important tools for detecting and studying normal embryogenesis and developmental disorders. To date, microCT imaging of vertebrate embryos was mostly done on embryos that have been stained with an X‚Äêray dense contrast agent. Here, we describe an alternative imaging procedure that allows to visualize embryo morphology and organ development in unstained FFPE embryos. Two aspects are critical for high‚Äêquality data acquisition: (i) a proper sample mounting leaving as little as possible paraffin around the sample and (ii) an image filtering pipeline that improves signal‚Äêto‚Äênoise ratio in these inherently low‚Äêcontrast data sets. The presented workflow allows overview imaging of the whole embryo proper and can be used for determination of organ volumes and development. Furthermore, we show that high‚Äêresolution interior tomographies can provide virtual histology information from selected regions of interest. In addition, we demonstrate that microCT scanned embryos remain intact during the scanning procedure allowing for a subsequent investigation by routine histology and/or immunohistochemistry. This makes the presented workflow applicable also to archival paraffin‚Äêembedded material.

AB  - Recent advances in cancer research and diagnostics largely rely on new developments in microscopic or molecular profiling techniques, offering high levels of detail with respect to either spatial or molecular features, but usually not both. Here, we present an explainable machine-learning approach for the integrated profiling of morphological, molecular and clinical features from breast cancer histology. First, our approach allows for the robust detection of cancer cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in histological images, providing precise heatmap visualizations explaining the classifier decisions. Second, molecular features, including DNA methylation, gene expression, copy number variations, somatic mutations and proteins are predicted from histology. Molecular predictions reach balanced accuracies up to 78%, whereas accuracies of over 95% can be achieved for subgroups of patients. Finally, our explainable AI approach allows assessment of the link between morphological and molecular cancer properties. The resulting computational multiplex-histology analysis can help promote basic cancer research and precision medicine through an integrated diagnostic scoring of histological, clinical and molecular features.

AB  - Analysis of three-dimensional patient specimens is gaining increasing relevance for understanding the principles of tissue structure as well as the biology and mechanisms underlying disease. New technologies are improving our ability to visualize large volume of tissues with subcellular resolution. One resource often overlooked is archival tissue maintained for decades in hospitals and research archives around the world. Accessing the wealth of information stored within these samples requires the use of appropriate methods. This tutorial introduces the range of sample preparation and microscopy approaches available for three-dimensional visualization of archival tissue. We summarize key aspects of the relevant techniques and common issues encountered when using archival tissue, including registration and antibody penetration. We also discuss analysis pipelines required to process, visualize and analyze the data and criteria to guide decision-making. The methods outlined in this tutorial provide an important and sustainable avenue for validating three-dimensional tissue organization and mechanisms of disease.

AB  - A central challenge in biology is obtaining high-content, high-resolution information while analyzing tissue samples at volumes relevant to disease progression. We address this here with CODA, a method to reconstruct exceptionally large (up to multicentimeter cubed) tissues at subcellular resolution using serially sectioned hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections. Here we demonstrate CODA‚Äôs ability to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) distinct microanatomical structures in pancreas, skin, lung and liver tissues. CODA allows creation of readily quantifiable tissue volumes amenable to biological research. As a testbed, we assess the microanatomy of the human pancreas during tumorigenesis within the branching pancreatic ductal system, labeling ten distinct structures to examine heterogeneity and structural transformation during neoplastic progression. We show that pancreatic precancerous lesions develop into distinct 3D morphological phenotypes and that pancreatic cancer tends to spread far from the bulk tumor along collagen fibers that are highly aligned to the 3D curves of ductal, lobular, vascular and neural structures. Thus, CODA establishes a means to transform broadly the structural study of human diseases through exploration of exhaustively labeled 3D microarchitecture.

AB  - High-throughput methods for slide-free three-dimensional (3D) pathological analyses of whole biopsies and surgical specimens offer the promise of modernizing traditional histology workflows and delivering improvements in diagnostic performance. Advanced optical methods now enable the interrogation of orders of magnitude more tissue than previously possible, where volumetric imaging allows for enhanced quantitative analyses of cell distributions and tissue structures that are prognostic and predictive. Non-destructive imaging processes can simplify laboratory workflows, potentially reducing costs, and can ensure that samples are available for subsequent molecular assays. However, the large size of the feature-rich datasets that they generate poses challenges for data management and computer-aided analysis. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the imaging technologies that enable 3D pathology, and the computational tools‚Äîmachine learning, in particular‚Äîfor image processing and interpretation. We also discuss the integration of various other diagnostic modalities with 3D pathology, along with the challenges and opportunities for clinical adoption and regulatory approval.

AB  - Organismal phenotypes frequently involve multiple organ systems. Histology is a powerful way to detect cellular and tissue phenotypes, but is largely descriptive and subjective. To determine how synchrotron-based X-ray micro-tomography (micro-CT) can yield 3-dimensional whole-organism images suitable for quantitative histological phenotyping, we scanned whole zebrafish, a small vertebrate model with diverse tissues, at ~1 micron voxel resolutions. Micro-CT optimized for cellular characterization (histotomography) allows brain nuclei to be computationally segmented and assigned to brain regions, and cell shapes and volumes to be computed for motor neurons and red blood cells. Striking individual phenotypic variation was apparent from color maps of computed densities of brain nuclei. Unlike histology, the histotomography also allows the study of 3-dimensional structures of millimeter scale that cross multiple tissue planes. We expect the computational and visual insights into 3D cell and tissue architecture provided by histotomography to be useful for reference atlases, hypothesis generation, comprehensive organismal screens, and diagnostics.

AB  - Paraffin embedding is widely used in microscopic imaging for preparing biological specimens. However, owing to significant fluorescence quenching during the embedding process, it is not compatible with fluorescent-labeling techniques, such as transgenic and viral labeling using green fluorescent protein (GFP). Here, we investigate the quenching mechanism and optimize the embedding process to improve the preservation of fluorescence intensity. The results show that dehydration is the main reason for fluorescence quenching during paraffin embedding, caused by the full denaturation of GFP molecules in ethyl alcohol. To evaluate fluorescent and morphological preservation, we modified the embedding process using tertiary butanol (TBA) instead of ethyl alcohol. Fluorescence intensity following TBA dehydration increased 12.08-fold of that observed in the traditional method. We obtained uniform fluorescence maintenance throughout the whole mouse brain, while the continuous apical dendrites, spines, and axon terminals were shown evenly within the cortex, hippocampus, and the amygdala. Moreover, we embedded a whole rat brain labeled with AAV in the prelimbic cortex (Prl). With the axon terminals in different areas, such as the caudate putamen, thalamus, and pyramidal tract, the results showed a continuous tract of Prl neurons throughout the whole brain. This method was also suitable for tdTomota labeled samples. These findings indicate that this modified embedding method could be compatible with GFP and provides a potential turning point for applications in the fluorescent labeling of samples.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the value of synchrotron-based phase-contrast microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) in pulmonary vascular pathobiology. The microanatomy of the lung is complex with intricate branching patterns. Tissue sections are therefore difficult to interpret. Recruited intrapulmonary bronchopulmonary anastomoses (IBAs) have been described in several forms of pulmonary hypertension, including alveolar capillary dysplasia with misaligned pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV). Here, we examine paraffin-embedded tissue using this nondestructive method for high-resolution three-dimensional imaging. Blocks of healthy and ACD/MPV lung tissue were used. Pulmonary and bronchial arteries in the ACD/MPV block had been preinjected with dye. One section per block was stained, and areas of interest were marked to allow precise beam-alignment during image acquisition at the X02DA TOMCAT beamline (Swiss Light Source). A √ó4 magnifying objective coupled to a 20-¬µm thick scintillating material and a sCMOS detector yielded the best trade-off between spatial resolution and field-of-view. A phase retrieval algorithm was applied and virtual tomographic slices and video clips of the imaged volumes were produced. Dye injections generated a distinct attenuation difference between vessels and surrounding tissue, facilitating segmentation and three-dimensional rendering. Histology and immunohistochemistry post-imaging offered complementary information. IBAs were confirmed in ACD/MPV, and the MPVs were positioned like bronchial veins/venules. We demonstrate the advantages of using synchrotron-based phase-contrast micro-CT for three-dimensional characterization of pulmonary microvascular anatomy in paraffin-embedded tissue. Vascular dye injections add additional value. We confirm intrapulmonary shunting in ACD/MPV and provide support for the hypothesis that MPVs are dilated bronchial veins/venules.

AB  - Machine learning is proving invaluable across disciplines. However, its success is often limited by the quality and quantity of available data, while its adoption is limited by the level of trust afforded by given models. Human vs. machine performance is commonly compared empirically to decide whether a certain task should be performed by a computer or an expert. In reality, the optimal learning strategy may involve combining the complementary strengths of humans and machines. Here, we present expert-augmented machine learning (EAML), an automated method that guides the extraction of expert knowledge and its integration into machine-learned models. We used a large dataset of intensive-care patient data to derive 126 decision rules that predict hospital mortality. Using an online platform, we asked 15 clinicians to assess the relative risk of the subpopulation defined by each rule compared to the total sample. We compared the clinician-assessed risk to the empirical risk and found that, while clinicians agreed with the data in most cases, there were notable exceptions where they overestimated or underestimated the true risk. Studying the rules with greatest disagreement, we identified problems with the training data, including one miscoded variable and one hidden confounder. Filtering the rules based on the extent of disagreement between clinician-assessed risk and empirical risk, we improved performance on out-of-sample data and were able to train with less data. EAML provides a platform for automated creation of problem-specific priors, which help build robust and dependable machine-learning models in critical applications.

AB  - The spread of microtomography as a tool for visualization of soft tissues has had a significant impact on a better understanding of complex biological systems. This technique allows a detailed three-dimensional quantitative view of the specimen to be obtained, correlating its morphological organization with its function, providing valuable insights on the functionality of the tissue. Regularly overlooked, but of great importance, proper sample mounting and preparation are fundamental for achieving the highest possible image quality even for the high-resolution imaging systems currently under development. Here, a quantitative analysis compares some of the most common sample-mounting strategies used for synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography of soft tissues: alcoholic-immersion, paraffin-embedding and critical-point drying. These three distinct sample-mounting strategies were performed on the same specimen in order to investigate their impact on sample morphology regardless of individual sample variation. In that sense, the alcoholic-immersion strategy, although causing less shrinkage to the tissue, proved to be the most unsuitable approach for a high-throughput high-resolution imaging experiment due to sample drifting. Also, critical-point drying may present some interesting advantages regarding image quality but is also incompatible with a high-throughput experiment. Lastly, paraffin-embedding is shown to be the most suitable strategy for current soft tissue microtomography experiments. Such detailed analysis of biological sample-mounting strategies for synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography are expected to offer valuable insights on the best approach for using this technique for 3D imaging of soft tissues and following morphometric analysis.

AB  - For over a hundred years, the histological study of tissues has been the gold standard for medical diagnosis because histology allows all cell types in every tissue to be identified and characterized. Our laboratory is actively working to make technological advances in X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) that will bring the diagnostic power of histology to the study of full tissue volumes at cellular resolution (i.e., an X-ray Histo-tomography modality). Toward this end, we have made targeted improvements to the sample preparation pipeline. One key optimization, and the focus of the present work, is a straightforward method for rigid embedding of fixed and stained millimeter-scale samples. Many of the published methods for sample immobilization and correlative micro-CT imaging rely on placing the samples in paraffin wax, agarose, or liquids such as alcohol. Our approach extends this work with custom procedures and the design of a 3-dimensional printable apparatus to embed the samples in an acrylic resin directly into polyimide tubing, which is relatively transparent to X-rays. Herein, sample preparation procedures are described for the samples from 0.5 to 10 mm in diameter, which would be suitable for whole zebrafish larvae and juveniles, or other animals and tissue samples of similar dimensions. As proof of concept, we have embedded the specimens from Danio, Drosophila, Daphnia, and a mouse embryo; representative images from 3-dimensional scans for three of these samples are shown. Importantly, our methodology leads to multiple benefits including rigid immobilization, long-term preservation of laboriously-created resources, and the ability to re-interrogate samples.

AB  - We introduce prediction-powered inference $\unicode{x2013}$ a framework for performing valid statistical inference when an experimental data set is supplemented with predictions from a machine-learning system. Our framework yields provably valid conclusions without making any assumptions on the machine-learning algorithm that supplies the predictions. Higher accuracy of the predictions translates to smaller confidence intervals, permitting more powerful inference. Prediction-powered inference yields simple algorithms for computing valid confidence intervals for statistical objects such as means, quantiles, and linear and logistic regression coefficients. We demonstrate the benefits of prediction-powered inference with data sets from proteomics, genomics, electronic voting, remote sensing, census analysis, and ecology.

AB  - Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of cancer patients are of high clinical relevance. Since detection and isolation of CTCs often rely on cell dimensions, knowledge of their size is key. We analyzed the median CTC size in a large cohort of breast (BC), prostate (PC), colorectal (CRC), and bladder (BLC) cancer patients. Images of patient-derived CTCs acquired on cartridges of the FDA-cleared CellSearch¬Æ method were retrospectively collected and automatically re-analyzed using the accept software package. The median CTC diameter (Œºm) was computed per tumor type. The size differences between the different tumor types and references (tumor cell lines and leukocytes) were nonparametrically tested. A total of 1962 CellSearch¬Æ cartridges containing 71¬†612 CTCs were included. In BC, the median computed diameter (CD) of patient-derived CTCs was 12.4¬†Œºm vs 18.4¬†Œºm for cultured cell line cells. For PC, CDs were 10.3¬†Œºm for CTCs vs 20.7¬†Œºm for cultured cell line cells. CDs for CTCs of CRC and BLC were 7.5¬†Œºm and 8.6¬†Œºm, respectively. Finally, leukocytes were 9.4¬†Œºm. CTC size differed statistically significantly between the four tumor types and between CTCs and the reference data. CTC size differences between tumor types are striking and CTCs are smaller than cell line tumor cells, whose size is often used as reference when developing CTC analysis methods. Based on our data, we suggest that the size of CTCs matters and should be kept in mind when designing and optimizing size-based isolation methods.

AB  - Medical Histology is the microscopic study of tissues and organs through sectioning, staining, and examining those sections under a microscope. Often called microscopic anatomy and histochemistry, histology allows for the visualization of tissue structure and characteristic changes the tissue may have undergone. Because of this, it is utilized in medical diagnosis, scientific study, autopsy, and forensic investigation. Once the tissue sample has undergone fixation, processing, embedding, sectioning, and staining, it can undergo analysis through microscopy and the findings interpreted by a pathologist. The histological stains chosen for a given specimen depends on the investigational question at hand. Advanced interpretation of the histology slide combined with a patient‚Äôs medical history can make an invaluable impact on the treatment course and prognosis.

AB  - Prostate cancer treatment decisions rely heavily on subjective visual interpretation [assigning Gleason patterns or International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade groups] of limited numbers of two-dimensional (2D) histology sections. Under this paradigm, interobserver variance is high, with ISUP grades not correlating well with outcome for individual patients, and this contributes to the over- and undertreatment of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated improved prognostication of prostate cancer outcomes based on computational analyses of glands and nuclei within 2D whole slide images. Our group has also shown that the computational analysis of three-dimensional (3D) glandular features, extracted from 3D pathology datasets of whole intact biopsies, can allow for improved recurrence prediction compared to corresponding 2D features. Here we seek to expand on these prior studies by exploring the prognostic value of 3D shape-based nuclear features in prostate cancer (e.g. nuclear size, sphericity). 3D pathology datasets were generated using open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscopy of 102 cancer-containing biopsies extracted ex vivo from the prostatectomy specimens of 46 patients. A deep learning-based workflow was developed for 3D nuclear segmentation within the glandular epithelium versus stromal regions of the biopsies. 3D shape-based nuclear features were extracted, and a nested cross-validation scheme was used to train a supervised machine classifier based on 5-year biochemical recurrence (BCR) outcomes. Nuclear features of the glandular epithelium were found to be more prognostic than stromal cell nuclear features (area under the ROC curve [AUC]‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.72 versus 0.63). 3D shape-based nuclear features of the glandular epithelium were also more strongly associated with the risk of BCR than analogous 2D features (AUC‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.72 versus 0.62). The results of this preliminary investigation suggest that 3D shape-based nuclear features are associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness and could be of value for the development of decision-support tools. ¬© 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

AB  - The Gleason score is one of the most important parameters for therapeutic decision-making in prostate cancer patients. Gleason growth patterns are defined by their histological features on 4- to 5-¬µm cross sections, and little is known about their three-dimensional architecture. Our objective was to characterize the three-dimensional architecture of prostate cancer growth patterns. Intact tissue punches (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ46) of representative Gleason growth patterns from radical prostatectomy specimens were fluorescently stained with antibodies targeting Keratin 8/18 and Keratin 5 for the detection of luminal and basal epithelial cells, respectively. Punches were optically cleared in benzyl alcohol‚Äìbenzyl benzoate and imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope up to a depth of 500‚Äâ¬µm. Gleason pattern 3, poorly formed pattern 4, and cords pattern 5 all formed a continuum of interconnecting tubules in which the diameter of the structures and the lumen size decreased with higher grades. In fused pattern 4, the interconnections between the tubules were markedly closer together. In these patterns, all tumor cells were in direct contact with the surrounding stroma. In contrast, cribriform Gleason pattern 4 and solid pattern 5 demonstrated a three-dimensional continuum of contiguous tumor cells, in which the vast majority of cells had no contact with the surrounding stroma. Transitions between cribriform pattern 4 and solid pattern 5 were seen. There was a decrease in the number and size of intercellular lumens from cribriform to solid growth pattern. Glomeruloid pattern 4 formed an intermediate structure consisting of a tubular network with intraluminal epithelial protrusions close to the tubule splitting points. In conclusion, three-dimensional microscopy revealed two major architectural subgroups of prostate cancer growth patterns: (1) a tubular interconnecting network including Gleason pattern 3, poorly formed and fused Gleason pattern 4, and cords Gleason pattern 5, and (2) serpentine contiguous epithelial proliferations including cribriform Gleason pattern 4 and solid Gleason pattern 5.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which is characterized by increasing dementia. It is accompanied by the development of extracellular Œ≤-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the gray matter of the brain. Histology is the gold standard for the visualization of this pathology, but also has intrinsic shortcomings. Fully three-dimensional analysis and quantitative metrics of alterations in the tissue structure require a complementary approach. In this work we use x-ray phase-contrast tomography to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of human hippocampal tissue affected by AD. Due to intrinsic electron density differences, tissue components and structures such as the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, blood vessels, or mineralized plaques can be identified and segmented in large volumes. Based on correlative histology, protein (tau, Œ≤-amyloid) and elemental content (iron, calcium) can be attributed to certain morphological features occurring in the entire volume. In the vicinity of senile plaques, an accumulation of microglia in combination with a loss of neuronal cells can be observed.

AB  - Knowledge of the three-dimensional (3d) neuronal cytoarchitecture is an important factor in order to understand the connection between tissue structure and function or to visualize pathological changes in neurodegenerative diseases or tumor development. The gold standard in neuropathology is histology, a technique which provides insights into the cellular organization based on sectioning of the sample. Conventional histology, however, misses the complete 3d information as only individual two-dimensional slices through the object are available. In this work, we use propagation-based phase-contrast x-ray tomography to perform 3d virtual histology on cerebellar tissue from mice. This technique enables us to non-invasively visualize the entire 3d density distribution of the examined samples at isotropic (sub-)cellular resolution. One central challenge, however, of the technique is the fact that contrast for important structural features can be easily lost due to small electron density differences, notably between the cells and surrounding tissue. Here, we evaluate the influence of different embedding media, which are intermediate steps in sample preparation for classical histology, on contrast formation and examine the applicability of the different sample preparations both at a synchrotron-based holotomography setup as well as a laboratory source.

AB  - The Gleason score contributes significantly in predicting prostate cancer outcomes and selecting the appropriate treatment option, which is affected by well-known inter-observer variations. We present a novel deep learning-based automated Gleason grading system that does not require extensive region-level manual annotations by experts and/or complex algorithms for the automatic generation of region-level annotations. A total of 6664 and 936 prostate needle biopsy single-core slides (689 and 99 cases) from two institutions were used for system discovery and validation, respectively. Pathological diagnoses were converted into grade groups and used as the reference standard. The grade group prediction accuracy of the system was 77.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 72.3‚Äì82.7%), the Cohen‚Äôs kappa score (Œ∫) was 0.650 (95% CI: 0.570‚Äì0.730), and the quadratic-weighted kappa score (Œ∫quad) was 0.897 (95% CI: 0.815‚Äì0.979). When trained on 621 cases from one institution and validated on 167 cases from the other institution, the system‚Äôs accuracy reached 67.4% (95% CI: 63.2‚Äì71.6%), Œ∫ 0.553 (95% CI: 0.495‚Äì0.610), and the Œ∫quad 0.880 (95% CI: 0.822‚Äì0.938). In order to evaluate the impact of the proposed method, performance comparison with several baseline methods was also performed. While limited by case volume and a few more factors, the results of this study can contribute to the potential development of an artificial intelligence system to diagnose other cancers without extensive region-level annotations.

AB  - Simple Summary
Gleason grading of prostate cancer is essential for treatment strategies and patient prognosis. Previous studies showed grading variation between pathologists when grading prostate cancer. Our study analyzed the presence and extent of grading variation between and within pathology laboratories in The Netherlands. In our nationwide retrospective study, we analyzed prostate needle biopsy reports of 35,258 patients in The Netherlands graded by 40 pathology laboratories. We found a considerable variation between and within pathology laboratories, as over half of the laboratories graded significantly different from the national mean. This likely affects treatment strategy and prognosis assessment of prostate cancer patients.

Abstract
Purpose: Our aim was to analyze grading variation between pathology laboratories and between pathologists within individual laboratories using nationwide real-life data. Methods: We retrieved synoptic (n = 13,397) and narrative (n = 29,377) needle biopsy reports from the Dutch Pathology Registry and prostate-specific antigen values from The Netherlands Cancer Registration for prostate cancer patients diagnosed between January 2017 and December 2019. We determined laboratory-specific proportions per histologic grade and unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) for International Society of Urological Pathologists Grades 1 vs. 2‚Äì5 for 40 laboratories due to treatment implications for higher grades. Pathologist-specific proportions were determined for 21 laboratories that consented to this part of analysis. The synoptic reports of 21 laboratories were used for analysis of case-mix correction for PSA, age, year of diagnosis, number of biopsies and positive cores. Results: A total of 38,321 reports of 35,258 patients were included. Grade 1 ranged between 19.7% and 44.3% per laboratory (national mean = 34.1%). Out of 40 laboratories, 22 (55%) reported a significantly deviant OR, ranging from 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39‚Äì0.59) to 1.54 (CI 1.22‚Äì1.93). Case-mix correction was performed for 10,294 reports, altering the status of 3/21 (14%) laboratories, but increasing the observed variation (20.8% vs. 17.7%). Within 15/21 (71%) of laboratories, significant inter-pathologist variation existed. Conclusion: Substantial variation in prostate cancer grading was observed between and within Dutch pathology laboratories. Case-mix correction did not explain the variation. Better standardization of prostate cancer grading is warranted to optimize and harmonize treatment.

AB  - The Gleason score is an important parameter for clinical outcome in prostate cancer patients. Gleason score 8 is a heterogeneous disease including Gleason score 3‚Äâ+‚Äâ5, 4‚Äâ+‚Äâ4, and 5‚Äâ+‚Äâ3 tumors, and encompasses a broad range of tumor growth patterns. Our objective was to characterize individual growth patterns and identify prognostic parameters in Gleason score 8 prostate cancer patients. We reviewed 1064 radical prostatectomy specimens, recorded individual Gleason 4 and 5 growth patterns as well as presence of intraductal carcinoma, and evaluated biochemical recurrence- and metastasis-free survival. Gleason score 8 disease was identified in 140 (13%) patients, of whom 76 (54%) had Gleason score 3‚Äâ+‚Äâ5, 46 (33%) 4‚Äâ+‚Äâ4, and 18 (13%) 5‚Äâ+‚Äâ3 disease. Invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ87, 62%) was observed more frequently in Gleason score 4‚Äâ+‚Äâ4 (93%) than 3‚Äâ+‚Äâ5 (47%; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) and 5‚Äâ+‚Äâ3 (44%; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) patients. Gleason pattern 5 was present in 110 (79%) men: as single cells and/or cords in 99 (90%) and solid fields in 32 (29%) cases. Solid field pattern 5 coexisted with cribriform architecture (23/32, 72%) more frequently than nonsolid pattern 5 cases (36/78, 46%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02). In multivariable analysis including age, prostate-specific antigen, pT-stage, surgical margin status, and lymph node metastases, presence of cribriform architecture was an independent parameter for biochemical recurrence-free (hazard ratio (HR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0‚Äì3.7; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04) and metastasis-free (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.0‚Äì12.3; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05) survival. In conclusion, invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma occurs more frequently in Gleason score 4‚Äâ+‚Äâ4 prostate cancer patients than in Gleason score 3‚Äâ+‚Äâ5 and 5‚Äâ+‚Äâ3, and is an independent parameter for biochemical recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, cribriform architecture has added value in risk stratification of Gleason score 8 prostate cancer patients.

AB  - The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading¬†system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images¬†into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis.

TI  - Grading of prostatic adenocarcinoma: current state and prognostic implications

T2  - Diagnostic Pathology
AB  - Background
Despite significant changes in the clinical and histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer, the Gleason grading system remains one of the most powerful prognostic predictors in prostate cancer. The correct diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer is crucial for a patient‚Äôs prognosis and therapeutic options. However, this system has undergone significant revisions and continues to have deficiencies that can potentially impact patient care.

Main Body
We describe the current state of grading prostate cancer, focusing on the current guidelines for the Gleason grading system and recent changes from the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma. We also explore the limitations of the current Gleason grading system and present a validated alternative to the Gleason score. The new grading system initially described in 2013 in a study from Johns Hopkins Hospital and then validated in a multi-institutional study, includes five distinct Grade Groups based on the modified Gleason score groups. Grade Group 1‚Äâ=‚ÄâGleason score ‚â§6, Grade Group 2‚Äâ=‚ÄâGleason score 3‚Äâ+‚Äâ4‚Äâ=‚Äâ7, Grade Group 3‚Äâ=‚ÄâGleason score 4‚Äâ+‚Äâ3‚Äâ=‚Äâ7, Grade Group 4‚Äâ=‚ÄâGleason score 8, Grade Group 5‚Äâ=‚ÄâGleason scores 9 and 10.

Conclusion
As this new grading system is simpler and more accurately reflects prostate cancer biology, it is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be used in conjunction with Gleason grading.

AB  - Breast cancer management depends on biomarkers including estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ER/PR/HER2). Though existing scoring systems are widely used and well-validated, they can involve costly preparation and variable interpretation. Additionally, discordances between histology and expected biomarker findings can prompt repeat testing to address biological, interpretative, or technical reasons for unexpected results.

AB  - The recent incidence of cutaneous melanoma of different thicknesses in the US is not well described.To evaluate recent patterns in the incidence of melanoma by tumor thickness and examine associations of sex, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status with melanoma thickness-specific incidence.This population-based cohort study analyzed data for 187‚ÄØ487 patients with a new diagnosis of invasive cutaneous melanoma from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Registry from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2018. The study was conducted from May 27 to December 29, 2021. Data were analyzed from June 21 to October 24, 2021.Age-adjusted incidence rates of melanoma were calculated by tumor thickness (categorized by Breslow thickness) and annual percentage change (APC) in incidence rates. Analyses were stratified by sex and race and ethnicity. The associations with socioeconomic status were evaluated in 134‚ÄØ359 patients diagnosed with melanoma from 2010 to 2016.This study included 187‚ÄØ487 patients with a median (IQR) age of 62 (52-72) years and 58.4% men. Melanoma incidence was higher in men compared with women across all tumor thickness groups. Individuals in lower socioeconomic status quintiles and members of minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed with thicker (T4) tumors (20.7% [169 of 816] among non-Hispanic Black patients, 11.2% [674 of 6042] among Hispanic patients, and 6.3% [10 774 of 170 155] among non-Hispanic White patients). Between 2010 and 2018, there was no significant increase in incidence of cutaneous melanoma across the full population (APC, 0.39%; 95% CI, ‚Äì0.40% to 1.18%). The incidence of the thickest melanomas (T4, &gt;4.0 mm) increased between 2010 and 2018, with an APC of 3.32% (95% CI, 2.06%-4.60%) overall, 2.50% (95% CI, 1.27%-3.73%) in men, and 4.64% (95% CI, 2.56%-6.75%) in women.In this population-based cohort study, the incidence of the thickest cutaneous melanoma tumors increased from 2010 to 2018, in contrast with the incidence patterns for thinner melanomas. The findings suggest potential stabilization of overall melanoma incidence rates in the US after nearly a century of continuous increase in incidence. Patients with low socioeconomic status and Hispanic patients were more likely to be diagnosed with thick melanoma. The continued rise in incidence of thick melanoma is unlikely to be attributable to overdiagnosis given the stability of thin melanoma rates.

AB  - In the late 19th century, formalin fixation with paraffin-embedding (FFPE) of tissues was developed as a fixation and conservation method and is still used to this day in routine clinical and pathological practice. The implementation of state-of-the-art nucleic acid sequencing technologies has sparked much interest for using historical FFPE samples stored in biobanks as they hold promise in extracting new information from these valuable samples. However, formalin fixation chemically modifies DNA, which potentially leads to incorrect sequences or misinterpretations in downstream processing and data analysis. Many publications have concentrated on one type of DNA damage, but few have addressed the complete spectrum of FFPE-DNA damage. Here, we review mitigation strategies in (I) pre-analytical sample quality control, (II) DNA repair treatments, (III) analytical sample preparation¬†and (IV) bioinformatic analysis of FFPE-DNA. We then provide recommendations that are tested and illustrated with DNA from 13-year-old liver specimens, one FFPE preserved and one fresh frozen, applying target-enriched sequencing. Thus, we show how DNA damage can be compensated, even when using low quantities (50 ng) of fragmented FFPE-DNA (DNA integrity number 2.0) that cannot be amplified well (Q129 bp/Q41 bp¬†=¬†5%). Finally, we provide a checklist called ‚ÄòERROR-FFPE-DNA‚Äô¬†that summarises recommendations for the minimal information in publications required for assessing fitness-for-purpose and inter-study comparison when using FFPE samples.

AB  - The state and behaviour of a cell can be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. In particular, tumour progression is determined by underlying genetic aberrations1‚Äì4 as well as the makeup of the tumour microenvironment5,6. Quantifying the contributions of these factors requires new technologies that can accurately measure the spatial location of genomic sequence together with phenotypic readouts. Here we developed slide-DNA-seq, a method for capturing spatially resolved DNA sequences from intact tissue sections. We demonstrate that this method accurately preserves local tumour architecture and enables the¬†de novo discovery of distinct tumour clones and their copy number alterations. We then apply slide-DNA-seq to a mouse model of¬†metastasis and a primary human cancer, revealing that clonal populations are confined to distinct spatial regions. Moreover, through integration with spatial transcriptomics, we uncover distinct sets of genes that are associated with clone-specific genetic aberrations, the local tumour microenvironment, or both. Together, this multi-modal spatial genomics approach provides a versatile platform for quantifying how cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors contribute to gene expression, protein abundance and other cellular phenotypes.

AB  - Melanoma is a common cancer in the Western world with an increasing incidence. Sun exposure is still considered to be the major risk factor for melanoma. The prognosis of patients with malignant (advanced-stage) melanoma differs widely between countries, but public campaigns advocating early detection have led to significant reductions in mortality rates. As well as sun exposure, distinct genetic alterations have been identified as associated with melanoma. For example, families with melanoma who have germline mutations in CDKN2A are well known, whereas the vast majority of sporadic melanomas have mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, which is the pathway with the highest oncogenic and therapeutic relevance for this disease. BRAF and NRAS mutations are typically found in cutaneous melanomas, whereas KIT mutations are predominantly observed in mucosal and acral melanomas. GNAQ and GNA11 mutations prevail in uveal melanomas. Additionally, the PI3K‚ÄìAKT‚ÄìPTEN pathway and the immune checkpoint pathways are important. The finding that programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) and PDL2 are expressed by melanoma cells, T cells, B cells and natural killer cells led to the recent development of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)-specific antibodies (for example, nivolumab and pembrolizumab). Alongside other new drugs ‚Äî namely, BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitors (trametinib and cobimetinib) ‚Äî these agents are very promising and have been shown to significantly improve prognosis for patients with advanced-stage metastatic disease. Early signs are apparent that these new treatment modalities are also improving long-term clinical benefit and the quality of life of patients.

AB  - Computerized clinical image analysis is shown to improve diagnostic accuracy for cutaneous melanoma but its effectiveness in preoperative assessment of melanoma thickness has not been studied. The aim of this study, is to explore how melanoma thickness correlates with computer-assisted objectively obtained color and geometric variables. All patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma with available clinical images prior to tumor excision were included in the study. All images underwent digital processing with an automated non-commercial software. The software provided measurements for geometrical variables, i.e., overall lesion surface, maximum diameter, perimeter, circularity, eccentricity, mean radius, as well as for color variables, i.e., range, standard deviation, coefficient of variation and skewness in the red, green, and blue color space.

AB  - Detection and segmentation of abnormalities on medical images is highly important for patient management including diagnosis, radiotherapy, response evaluation, as well as for quantitative image research. We present a fully automated pipeline for the detection and volumetric segmentation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) developed and validated on 1328 thoracic CT scans from 8 institutions. Along with quantitative performance detailed by image slice thickness, tumor size, image interpretation difficulty, and tumor location, we report an in-silico prospective clinical trial, where we show that the proposed method is faster and more reproducible compared to the experts. Moreover, we demonstrate that on average, radiologists & radiation oncologists preferred automatic segmentations in 56% of the cases. Additionally, we evaluate the prognostic power of the automatic contours by applying RECIST criteria and measuring the tumor volumes. Segmentations by our method stratified patients into low and high survival groups with higher significance compared to those methods based on manual contours.

AB  - X-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT) is widely used for high-contrast 3D micron-scale imaging using nearly monochromatic X-rays at synchrotron beamlines. XPCT enables an order of magnitude improvement in image contrast of the reconstructed material interfaces with low X-ray absorption contrast. The dominant approaches to 3D reconstruction using XPCT relies on the use of phase-retrieval algorithms that make one or more limiting approximations for the experimental configuration and material properties. Since many experimental scenarios violate such approximations, the resulting reconstructions contain blur, artifacts, or other quantitative inaccuracies. Our solution to this problem is to formulate new iterative non-linear phase-retrieval (NLPR) algorithms that avoid such limiting approximations. Compared to the widely used state-of-the-art approaches, we show that our proposed algorithms result in sharp and quantitatively accurate reconstruction with reduced artifacts. Unlike existing NLPR algorithms, our approaches avoid the laborious manual tuning of regularization hyper-parameters while still achieving the stated goals. As an alternative to regularization, we propose explicit constraints on the material properties to constrain the solution space and solve the phase-retrieval problem. These constraints are easily user-configurable since they follow directly from the imaged object's dimensions and material properties.

AB  - Many applications of machine-learning methods involve an iterative protocol in which data are collected, a model is trained, and then outputs of that model are used to choose what data to consider next. For example, a data-driven approach for designing proteins is to train a regression model to predict the fitness of protein sequences and then use it to propose new sequences believed to exhibit greater fitness than observed in the training data. Since validating designed sequences in the wet laboratory is typically costly, it is important to quantify the uncertainty in the model‚Äôs predictions. This is challenging because of a characteristic type of distribution shift between the training and test data that arises in the design setting‚Äîone in which the training and test data are statistically dependent, as the latter is chosen based on the former. Consequently, the model‚Äôs error on the test data‚Äîthat is, the designed sequences‚Äîhas an unknown and possibly complex relationship with its error on the training data. We introduce a method to construct confidence sets for predictions in such settings, which account for the dependence between the training and test data. The confidence sets we construct have finite-sample guarantees that hold for any regression model, even when it is used to choose the test-time input distribution. As a motivating use case, we use real datasets to demonstrate how our method quantifies uncertainty for the predicted fitness of designed proteins and can therefore be used to select design algorithms that achieve acceptable tradeoffs between high predicted fitness and low predictive uncertainty.

AB  - The pathological assessment of surgical specimens during surgery can reduce the incidence of positive resection margins, which otherwise can result in additional surgeries or aggressive therapeutic regimens. To improve patient outcomes, intraoperative spectroscopic, fluorescence-based, structural, optoacoustic and radiological imaging techniques are being tested on freshly excised tissue. The specific clinical setting and tumour type largely determine whether endogenous or exogenous contrast is to be detected and whether the tumour specificity of the detected biomarker, image resolution, image-acquisition times or penetration depth are to be prioritized. In this Perspective, we describe current clinical standards for intraoperative tissue analysis and discuss how intraoperative imaging is being implemented. We also discuss potential implementations of intraoperative pathology-assisted surgery for clinical decision-making.

AB  - We previously described X-ray histotomography, a high-resolution, non-destructive form of X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) imaging customized for three-dimensional (3D), digital histology, allowing quantitative, volumetric tissue and organismal phenotyping (Ding et al., 2019). Here, we have combined micro-CT with a novel application of ionic silver staining to characterize melanin distribution in whole zebrafish larvae. The resulting images enabled whole-body, computational analyses of regional melanin content and morphology. Normalized micro-CT reconstructions of silver-stained fish consistently reproduced pigment patterns seen by light microscopy, and further allowed direct quantitative comparisons of melanin content across wild-type and mutant samples, including subtle phenotypes not previously noticed. Silver staining of melanin for micro-CT provides proof-of-principle for whole-body, 3D computational phenomic analysis of a specific cell type at cellular resolution, with potential applications in other model organisms and melanocytic neoplasms. Advances such as this in whole-organism, high-resolution phenotyping provide superior context for studying the phenotypic effects of genetic, disease, and environmental variables.

AB  - Tissue clearing of gross anatomical samples was first described over a century ago and has only recently found widespread use in the field of microscopy. This renaissance has been driven by the application of modern knowledge of optical physics and chemical engineering to the development of robust and reproducible clearing techniques, the arrival of new microscopes that can image large samples at cellular resolution and computing infrastructure able to store and analyze large data volumes. Many biological relationships between structure and function require investigation in three dimensions and tissue clearing therefore has the potential to enable broad discoveries in the biological sciences. Unfortunately, the current literature is complex and could confuse researchers looking to begin a clearing project. The goal of this Primer is to outline a modular approach to tissue clearing that allows a novice researcher to develop a customized clearing pipeline tailored to their tissue of interest. Further, the Primer outlines the required imaging and computational infrastructure needed to perform tissue clearing at scale, gives an overview of current applications, discusses limitations and provides an outlook on future advances in the field.

AU  - Metscher, Brian D.
T2  - BMC Physiology
AB  - Comparative, functional, and developmental studies of animal morphology require accurate visualization of three-dimensional structures, but few widely applicable methods exist for non-destructive whole-volume imaging of animal tissues. Quantitative studies in particular require accurately aligned and calibrated volume images of animal structures. X-ray microtomography (microCT) has the potential to produce quantitative 3D images of small biological samples, but its widespread use for non-mineralized tissues has been limited by the low x-ray contrast of soft tissues. Although osmium staining and a few other techniques have been used for contrast enhancement, generally useful methods for microCT imaging for comparative morphology are still lacking.

AB  - Phase-contrast imaging techniques address the issue of poor soft-tissue contrast encountered in traditional X-ray imaging. This can be accomplished with the propagation-based phase-contrast technique by employing a coherent photon beam, which is available at synchrotron facilities, as well as long sample-to-detector distances. This study demonstrates the optimization of propagation-based phase-contrast computed tomography (CT) techniques for multiscale X-ray imaging of the breast at the Elettra synchrotron facility (Trieste, Italy). Two whole breast mastectomy samples were acquired with propagation-based breast-CT using a monochromatic synchrotron beam at a pixel size of 60¬†¬µm. Paraffin-embedded blocks sampled from the same tissues were scanned with propagation-based micro-CT imaging using a polychromatic synchrotron beam at a pixel size of 4¬†¬µm. Images of both methodologies and of the same sample were spatially registered. The resulting images showed the transition from whole breast imaging with propagation-based breast-CT methodology to virtual histology with propagation-based micro-CT imaging of the same sample. Additionally, conventional histological images were matched to virtual histology images. Phase-contrast images offer a high resolution with low noise, which allows for a highly precise match between virtual and conventional histology. Furthermore, those techniques allow a clear discernment of breast structures, lesions, and microcalcifications, being a promising clinically-compatible tool for breast imaging in a multiscale approach, to either assist in the detection of cancer in full volume breast samples or to complement structure identification in paraffin-embedded breast tissue samples.

AB  - The pathological diagnosis of melanoma can be challenging. The provision of an appropriate biopsy and pertinent history can assist in establishing an accurate diagnosis and reliable estimate of prognosis. In their reports, pathologists should document both the criteria on which the diagnosis was based as well as important prognostic parameters. For melanoma, such prognostic parameters include tumor thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, lymphovascular invasion, neurotropism, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Disease staging is important for risk stratifying melanoma patients into prognostic groups and patient management recommendations are often stage based. The 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Melanoma Staging System was implemented in 2018 and several important changes were made. Tumor thickness and ulceration remain the key T category criteria. T1b melanomas were redefined as either ulcerated melanomas <1.0‚Äâmm thick or nonulcerated melanomas 0.8‚Äì1.0‚Äâmm thick. Although mitotic rate was removed as a T category criterion in the 8th edition, it remains a very important prognostic factor and should continue to be documented in primary melanoma pathology reports. It was also recommended in the 8th edition that tumor thickness be recorded to the nearest 0.1‚Äâmm (rather than the nearest 0.01‚Äâmm). In the future, incorporation of additional prognostic parameters beyond those utilized in the current version of the staging system into (web based) prognostic models/clinical tools will likely facilitate more personalized prognostic estimates. Evaluation of molecular markers of prognosis is an active area of current research; however, additional data are needed before it would be appropriate to recommend use of such tests in routine clinical practice.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive form of human brain cancer that is under active study in the field of cancer biology. Its rapid progression and the relative time cost of obtaining molecular data make other readily available forms of data, such as images, an important resource for actionable measures in patients. Our goal is to use information given by medical images taken from GBM patients in statistical settings. To do this, we design a novel statistic‚Äîthe smooth Euler characteristic transform (SECT)‚Äîthat quantifies magnetic resonance images of tumors. Due to its well-defined inner product structure, the SECT can be used in a wider range of functional and nonparametric modeling approaches than other previously proposed topological summary statistics. When applied to a cohort of GBM patients, we find that the SECT is a better predictor of clinical outcomes than both existing tumor shape quantifications and common molecular assays. Specifically, we demonstrate that SECT features alone explain more of the variance in GBM patient survival than gene expression, volumetric features, and morphometric features. The main takeaways from our findings are thus 2-fold. First, they suggest that images contain valuable information that can play an important role in clinical prognosis and other medical decisions. Second, they show that the SECT is a viable tool for the broader study of medical imaging informatics. Supplementary materials for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.

AB  - Black-box machine learning models are now routinely used in high-risk settings, like medical diagnostics, which demand uncertainty quantification to avoid consequential model failures. Conformal prediction is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous uncertainty sets/intervals for the predictions of such models. Critically, the sets are valid in a distribution-free sense: they possess explicit, non-asymptotic guarantees even without distributional assumptions or model assumptions. One can use conformal prediction with any pre-trained model, such as a neural network, to produce sets that are guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. It is easy-to-understand, easy-to-use, and general, applying naturally to problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on. This hands-on introduction is aimed to provide the reader a working understanding of conformal prediction and related distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques with one self-contained document. We lead the reader through practical theory for and examples of conformal prediction and describe its extensions to complex machine learning tasks involving structured outputs, distribution shift, time-series, outliers, models that abstain, and more. Throughout, there are many explanatory illustrations, examples, and code samples in Python. With each code sample comes a Jupyter notebook implementing the method on a real-data example; the notebooks can be accessed and easily run using our codebase.

AB  - Histology and immunohistochemistry of thin tissue sections have been the standard diagnostic procedure in many diseases for decades. This method is highly specific for particular tissue regions or cells, but mechanical sectioning of the specimens is required, which destroys the sample in the process and can lead to non-uniform tissue deformations. In addition, regions of interest cannot be located beforehand and the analysis is intrinsically two-dimensional. Micro X-ray computed tomography (ŒºCT) on the other hand can provide 3D images at high resolution and allows for quantification of tissue structures, as well as the localization of small regions of interest. These advantages advocate the use of ŒºCT for virtual histology tool with or without subsequent classical histology. This review summarizes the most recent examples of virtual histology and provides currently known possibilities of improving contrast and resolution of ŒºCT. Following a background in ŒºCT imaging, ex vivo staining procedures for contrast enhancement are presented as well as label-free virtual histology approaches and the technologies, which could rapidly advance it, such as phase-contrast CT. Novel approaches such as zoom tomography and nanoparticulate contrast agents will also be considered. The current evidence suggests that virtual histology may present a valuable addition to the workflow of histological analysis, potentially reducing the workload in pathology, refining tissue classification, and supporting the detection of small malignancies.

AB  - The worldwide increase of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which still has one of the lowest survival rates, requires novel imaging tools to improve early detection and to refine diagnosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of propagation-based phase-contrast X-ray computed tomography of already paraffin-embedded and unlabeled human pancreatic tumor tissue to achieve a detailed three-dimensional (3D) view of the tumor sample in its entirety.

AB  - The examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissues on glass slides by conventional light microscopy is the foundation for histopathological diagnosis. However, this conventional method has some limitations in x-y axes due to its relatively narrow range of observation area and in z-axis due to its two-dimensionality. In this study, we applied a CUBIC pipeline, which is the most powerful tissue-clearing and three-dimensional (3D)-imaging technique, to clinical pathology. CUBIC was applicable to 3D imaging of both normal and abnormal patient-derived, human lung and lymph node tissues. Notably, the combination of deparaffinization and CUBIC enabled 3D imaging of specimens derived from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, allowing quantitative evaluation of nuclear and structural atypia of an archival malignant lymphoma tissue. Furthermore, to examine whether CUBIC can be applied to practical use in pathological diagnosis, we performed a histopathological screening of a lymph node metastasis based on CUBIC, which successfully improved the sensitivity in detecting minor metastatic carcinoma nodules in lymph nodes. Collectively, our results indicate that CUBIC significantly contributes to retrospective and prospective clinicopathological diagnosis, which might lead to the establishment of a novel field of medical science based on 3D histopathology.

AB  - We use deep transfer learning to quantify histopathological patterns across 17,355 hematoxylin and eosin-stained histopathology slide images from 28 cancer types and correlate these with matched genomic, transcriptomic and survival data. This approach accurately classifies cancer types and provides spatially resolved tumor and normal tissue distinction. Automatically learned computational histopathological features correlate with a large range of recurrent genetic aberrations across cancer types. This includes whole-genome duplications, which display universal features across cancer types, individual chromosomal aneuploidies, focal amplifications and deletions, as well as driver gene mutations. There are widespread associations between bulk gene expression levels and histopathology, which reflect tumor composition and enable the localization of transcriptomically defined tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Computational histopathology augments prognosis based on histopathological subtyping and grading, and highlights prognostically relevant areas such as necrosis or lymphocytic aggregates. These findings show the remarkable potential of computer vision in characterizing the molecular basis of tumor histopathology.

AB  - Molecular alterations in cancer can cause phenotypic changes in tumor cells and their microenvironment. Routine histopathology tissue slides, which are ubiquitously available, can reflect such morphological changes. Here, we show that deep learning can consistently infer a wide range of genetic mutations, molecular tumor subtypes, gene expression signatures and standard pathology biomarkers directly from routine histology. We developed, optimized, validated and publicly released a one-stop-shop workflow and applied it to tissue slides of more than 5,000 patients across multiple solid tumors. Our findings show that a single deep learning algorithm can be trained to predict a wide range of molecular alterations from routine, paraffin-embedded histology slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin. These predictions generalize to other populations and are spatially resolved. Our method can be implemented on mobile hardware, potentially enabling point-of-care diagnostics for personalized cancer treatment. More generally, this approach could elucidate and quantify genotype‚Äìphenotype links in cancer.

AB  - A multiscale three-dimensional (3D) virtual histology approach is presented, based on two configurations of propagation phase-contrast X-ray tomography, which have been implemented in close proximity at the GINIX endstation at the beamline P10/PETRA‚ÄÖIII (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). This enables the 3D reconstruction of characteristic morphological features of human pancreatic normal and tumor tissue, as obtained from cancer surgery, first in the form of a large-scale overview by parallel-beam illumination, followed by a zoom into a region-of-interest based on zoom tomography using a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror with additional waveguide optics. To this end 1‚ÄÖmm punch biopsies of the tissue were taken. In the parallel tomography, a volumetric throughput on the order of 0.01‚ÄÖmm3‚ÄÖs-1 was achieved, while maintaining the ability to segment isolated cells. With a continuous rotation during the scan, a total acquisition time of less than 2‚ÄÖmin was required for a full tomographic scan. Using the combination of both setups, islets of Langerhans, a three-dimensional cluster of cells in the endocrine part of the pancreas, could be located. Cells in such an islet were segmented and visualized in 3D. Further, morphological alterations of tumorous tissue of the pancreas were characterized. To this end, the anisotropy parameter Œ©, based on intensity gradients, was used in order to quantify the presence of collagen fibers within the entire biopsy specimen. This proof-of-concept experiment of the multiscale approach on human pancreatic tissue paves the way for future 3D virtual pathology.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in men. Despite the significant progress in cancer diagnosis and treatment over the last few years, the approach to disease detection and therapy still does not include histopathological biomarkers. The dissemination of PCa is strictly related to the creation of a premetastatic niche, which can be detected by altered levels of specific biomarkers. To date, the risk factors for biochemical recurrence include lymph node status, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density (PSAD), body mass index (BMI), pathological Gleason score, seminal vesicle invasion, extraprostatic extension, and intraductal carcinoma. In the future, biomarkers might represent another prognostic factor, as discussed in many studies. In this review, we focus on histopathological biomarkers (particularly CD169 macrophages, neuropilin-1, cofilin-1, interleukin-17, signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (STAT3), LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), CD15, AMACR, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), Appl1, Sortilin, Syndecan-1, and p63) and their potential application in decision making regarding the prognosis and treatment of PCa patients. We refer to studies that found a correlation between the levels of biomarkers and tumor characteristics as well as clinical outcomes. We also hypothesize about the potential use of histopathological markers as a target for novel immunotherapeutic drugs or targeted radionuclide therapy, which may be used as adjuvant therapy in the future.

AB  - BRCA1/2 are breast cancer susceptibility genes that are involved in DNA repair and transcriptional control. They are dysregulated in breast cancer, making them attractive therapeutic targets. Here, we performed a systematic multiomics analysis to expound BRCA1/2 functions as prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer. First, using different web-based bioinformatics platforms (Oncomine, TIMER 2.0, UALCAN, and cBioportal), the expression of BRCA1/2 was assessed. Then, the R package was used to analyze the diagnostic value of BRCA1/2 in patients. Next, we determined the relationship between BRCA1/2 mRNA expression and prognosis in patients (PrognoScan Database, R2: Kaplan Meier Scanner and Kaplan‚ÄìMeier Plotter). Subsequently, the association of BRCA1/2 with mutation frequency alteration and copy number alterations in breast cancer was investigated using the cBioportal platform. After that, we identified known and predicted structural genes and proteins essential for BRCA1/2 functions using GeneMania and STRING db. Finally, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed to elucidate the potential biological functions of the co-expression genes of BRCA1/2. The BRCA1/2 mRNA level in breast cancer tissues was considerably higher than in normal tissues, with AUCs of 0.766 and 0.829, respectively. Overexpression of BRCA1/2 was significantly related to the worse overall survival (p < 0.001) and was correlated to clinicopathological characteristics including lymph nodes, estrogen receptors, and progesterone receptors (p < 0.01). The alteration frequencies of both the gens have been checked, and the results show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 show different alteration frequencies. Their mutation sites differ from each other. GO and KEGG showed that BRCA1/2 was mainly enriched in catalytic activity, acting on DNA, chromosomal region, organelle fission, cell cycle, etc. The 20 most frequently changed genes were closely related to BRCA1/2, including PALB2 and RAD51 relatively. Our study provides suggestive evidence of the prognostic role of BRCA1/2 in breast cancer and the therapeutic target for breast cancer. Furthermore, BRCA1/2 may influence BRCA prognosis through catalytic activity, acting on DNA, chromosomal regions, organelle fission, and the cell cycle. Nevertheless, further validation is warranted.

AB  - Melanoma is a deadly skin cancer that becomes especially difficult to treat after it metastasizes. Timely identification of melanoma is critical for effective therapy, but histopathologic diagnosis can frequently pose a significant challenge to this goal. Therefore, auxiliary diagnostic tools are imperative to facilitating prompt recognition of malignant lesions. Melanoma develops as result of a number of genetic mutations, with UV radiation often acting as a mutagenic risk factor. Novel methods of genetic testing have improved detection of these molecular alterations, which subsequently revealed important information for diagnosis and prognosis. Rapid detection of genetic alterations is also significant for choosing appropriate treatment and developing targeted therapies for melanoma. This review will delve into the understanding of various mutations and the implications they may pose for clinical decision making.

The majority were from large national studies in the United Kingdom (EMBRACE), the Netherlands (HEBON), and France (GENEPSO). Follow-up ended December 2013; median follow-up was 5 years.BRCA1/2 mutations, family cancer history, and mutation location.Annual incidences, standardized incidence ratios, and cumulative risks of breast, ovarian, and contralateral breast cancer.Among 3886 women (median age, 38 years; interquartile range [IQR], 30-46 years) eligible for the breast cancer analysis, 5066 women (median age, 38 years; IQR, 31-47 years) eligible for the ovarian cancer analysis, and 2213 women (median age, 47 years; IQR, 40-55 years) eligible for the contralateral breast cancer analysis, 426 were diagnosed with breast cancer, 109 with ovarian cancer, and 245 with contralateral breast cancer during follow-up. The cumulative breast cancer risk to age 80 years was 72% (95% CI, 65%-79%) for BRCA1 and 69% (95% CI, 61%-77%) for BRCA2 carriers. Breast cancer incidences increased rapidly in early adulthood until ages 30 to 40 years for BRCA1 and until ages 40 to 50 years for BRCA2 carriers, then remained at a similar, constant incidence (20-30 per 1000 person-years) until age 80 years. The cumulative ovarian cancer risk to age 80 years was 44% (95% CI, 36%-53%) for BRCA1 and 17% (95% CI, 11%-25%) for BRCA2 carriers. For contralateral breast cancer, the cumulative risk 20 years after breast cancer diagnosis was 40% (95% CI, 35%-45%) for BRCA1 and 26% (95% CI, 20%-33%) for BRCA2 carriers (hazard ratio [HR] for comparing BRCA2 vs BRCA1, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47-0.82; P=.001 for difference). Breast cancer risk increased with increasing number of first- and second-degree relatives diagnosed as having breast cancer for both BRCA1 (HR for ‚â•2 vs 0 affected relatives, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.41-2.82; P&lt;.001 for trend) and BRCA2 carriers (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.08-3.37; P=.02 for trend). Breast cancer risk was higher if mutations were located outside vs within the regions bounded by positions c.2282-c.4071 in BRCA1 (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.11-1.93; P=.007) and c.2831-c.6401 in BRCA2 (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.36-2.74; P&lt;.001).These findings provide estimates of cancer risk based on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carrier status using prospective data collection and demonstrate the potential importance of family history and mutation location in risk assessment.

AB  - The pathological diagnosis of melanoma can be challenging. The provision of an appropriate biopsy and pertinent history can assist in establishing an accurate diagnosis and reliable estimate of prognosis. In their reports, pathologists should document both the criteria on which the diagnosis was based as well as important prognostic parameters. For melanoma, such prognostic parameters include tumor thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, lymphovascular invasion, neurotropism, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Disease staging is important for risk stratifying melanoma patients into prognostic groups and patient management recommendations are often stage based. The 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Melanoma Staging System was implemented in 2018 and several important changes were made. Tumor thickness and ulceration remain the key T category criteria. T1b melanomas were redefined as either ulcerated melanomas <1.0‚Äâmm thick or nonulcerated melanomas 0.8‚Äì1.0‚Äâmm thick. Although mitotic rate was removed as a T category criterion in the 8th edition, it remains a very important prognostic factor and should continue to be documented in primary melanoma pathology reports. It was also recommended in the 8th edition that tumor thickness be recorded to the nearest 0.1‚Äâmm (rather than the nearest 0.01‚Äâmm). In the future, incorporation of additional prognostic parameters beyond those utilized in the current version of the staging system into (web based) prognostic models/clinical tools will likely facilitate more personalized prognostic estimates. Evaluation of molecular markers of prognosis is an active area of current research; however, additional data are needed before it would be appropriate to recommend use of such tests in routine clinical practice.

AB  - We investigate structural properties of neurons in the granular layer of human cerebellum with respect to their involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS). To this end we analyze data recorded by X-ray phase contrast tomography from tissue samples collected post mortem from a MS and a healthy control group. Using automated segmentation and histogram analysis based on optimal transport theory (OT) we find that the distributions representing nuclear structure in the granular layer move to a more compact nuclear state, i.e. smaller, denser and more heterogeneous nuclei in MS. We have previously made a similar observation for neurons of the dentate gyrus in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, suggesting that more compact structure of neuronal nuclei which we attributed to increased levels of heterochromatin, may possibly represent a more general phenomenon of cellular senescence associated with neurodegeneration.

AB  - A principal challenge in the analysis of tissue imaging data is cell segmentation‚Äîthe task of identifying the precise boundary of every cell in an image. To address this problem we constructed TissueNet, a dataset for training segmentation models that contains more than 1‚Äâmillion manually labeled cells, an order of magnitude more than all previously published segmentation training datasets. We used TissueNet to train Mesmer, a deep-learning-enabled segmentation algorithm. We demonstrated that Mesmer is more accurate than previous methods, generalizes to the full diversity of tissue types and imaging platforms in TissueNet, and achieves human-level performance. Mesmer enabled the automated extraction of key cellular features, such as subcellular localization of protein signal, which was challenging with previous approaches. We then adapted Mesmer to harness cell lineage information in highly multiplexed datasets and used this enhanced version to quantify cell morphology changes during human gestation. All code, data and models are released as a community resource.

AB  - Recent years have seen increasing use of supervised learning methods for segmentation tasks. However, the predictive performance of these algorithms depends on the quality of labels. This problem is particularly pertinent in the medical image domain, where both the annotation cost and inter-observer variability are high. In a typical label acquisition process, different human experts provide their estimates of the ``true'' segmentation labels under the influence of their own biases and competence levels. Treating these noisy labels blindly as the ground truth limits the performance that automatic segmentation algorithms can achieve. In this work, we present a method for jointly learning, from purely noisy observations alone, the reliability of individual annotators and the true segmentation label distributions, using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the two is achieved by encouraging the estimated annotators to be maximally unreliable while achieving high fidelity with the noisy training data. We first define a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST and study the properties of the proposed algorithm. We then demonstrate the utility of the method on three public medical imaging segmentation datasets with simulated (when necessary) and real diverse annotations: 1) MSLSC (multiple-sclerosis lesions); 2) BraTS (brain tumours); 3) LIDC-IDRI (lung abnormalities). In all cases, our method outperforms competing methods and relevant baselines particularly in cases where the number of annotations is small and the amount of disagreement is large. The experiments also show strong ability to capture the complex spatial characteristics of annotators' mistakes.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction of tumors based on serial histological sectioning is one of the most powerful methods for accurate high-resolution visualization of tumor structures. However, 3D histological reconstruction of whole tumor has not yet been achieved. We established a high-resolution 3D model of molecular marked whole laryngeal cancer by optimizing the currently available techniques. A series of 5,388 HE stained or immunohistochemically stained whole light microscopic images (200‚Äâ√ó) were acquired (15.61¬†TB).The data set of block-face images (96.2¬†GB) was also captured. Direct volume rendering of serial 6.25‚Äâ√ó light microscopy images did not demonstrate the major characteristics of the laryngeal cancer as expected. Based on fusion of two datasets, the accurate boundary of laryngeal tumor bulk was visualized in an anatomically realistic context. In the regions of interest, micro tumor structure, budding, cell proliferation and tumor lymph vessels were well represented in 3D after segmentation, which highlighted the advantages of 3D reconstruction of light microscopy images. In conclusion, generating 3D digital histopathological images of a whole solid tumor based on current technology is feasible. However, data mining strategy should be developed for complete utilization of the large amount of data generated.

AB  - Phase-contrast computed tomography can visualize soft tissue samples with high contrast. At coherent sources, propagation-based imaging (PBI) techniques are among the most common, as they are easy to implement and produce high-resolution images. Their downside is a low degree of quantitative data due to simplifying assumptions of the sample properties in the reconstruction. These assumptions can be avoided, by using quantitative phase-contrast techniques as an alternative. However, these often compromise spatial resolution and require complicated setups. In order to overcome this limitation, we designed and constructed a new imaging setup using a 2D Talbot array illuminator as a wavefront marker and speckle-based imaging phase-retrieval techniques. We developed a post-processing chain that can compensate for wavefront marker drifts and that improves the overall sensitivity. By comparing two measurements of biomedical samples, we demonstrate that the spatial resolution of our setup is comparable to the one of PBI scans while being able to successfully image a sample that breaks the typical homogeneity assumption used in PBI.

AB  - Many histological methods require staining of the cytoplasm, which provides instrumental details for diagnosis. One major limitation is the production of 2D images obtained by destructive preparation of 3D tissue samples. X-ray absorption micro- and nanocomputed tomography (microCT and nanoCT) allows for a nondestructive investigation of a 3D tissue sample, and thus aids to determine regions of interest for further histological examinations. However, application of microCT and nanoCT to biological samples (e.g., biopsies) is limited by the missing contrast within soft tissue, which is important to visualize morphological details. We describe an eosin-based preparation overcoming the challenges of contrast enhancement and selectivity for certain tissues. The eosin-based staining protocol is suitable for whole-organ staining, which then enables high-resolution microCT imaging of whole organs and nanoCT imaging of smaller tissue pieces retrieved from the original sample. Our results demonstrate suitability of the eosin-based staining method for diagnostic screening of 3D tissue samples without impeding further diagnostics through histological methods.

AB  - Propagation-based X-ray phase-contrast computed tomography (PBI) has already proven its potential in a great variety of soft-tissue-related applications including lung imaging. However, the strong edge enhancement, caused by the phase effects, often hampers image segmentation and therefore the quantitative analysis of data sets. Here, the benefits of applying single-distance phase retrieval prior to the three-dimensional reconstruction (PhR) are discussed and quantified compared with three-dimensional reconstructions of conventional PBI data sets in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and preservation of image features. The PhR data sets show more than a tenfold higher CNR and only minor blurring of the edges when compared with PBI in a predominately absorption-based set-up. Accordingly, phase retrieval increases the sensitivity and provides more functionality in computed tomography imaging.

AB  - Despite being the hallmark of cancer that is responsible for the highest number of deaths, very little is known about the biology of metastasis. Metastatic disease typically manifests after a protracted period of undetectable disease following surgery or systemic therapy, owing to relapse or recurrence. In the case of breast cancer, metastatic relapse can occur months to decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we provide an overview of the known key factors that influence metastatic recurrence, with the goal of highlighting the critical unanswered questions that still need to be addressed to make a difference in the mortality of breast¬†cancer patients.

AB  - Pathology diagnostics relies on the assessment of morphology by trained experts, which remains subjective and qualitative. Here we developed a framework for large-scale histomorphometry (FLASH) performing deep learning-based semantic segmentation and subsequent large-scale extraction of interpretable, quantitative, morphometric features in non-tumour kidney histology. We use two internal and three external, multi-centre cohorts to analyse over 1000 kidney biopsies and nephrectomies. By associating morphometric features with clinical parameters, we confirm previous concepts and reveal unexpected relations. We show that the extracted features are independent predictors of long-term clinical outcomes in IgA-nephropathy. We introduce single-structure morphometric analysis by applying techniques from single-cell transcriptomics, identifying distinct glomerular populations and morphometric phenotypes along a trajectory of disease progression. Our study provides a concept for Next-generation Morphometry (NGM), enabling comprehensive quantitative pathology data mining, i.e., pathomics.

AB  - The current tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system alone cannot provide adequate information for prognosis and adjuvant chemotherapy benefits in patients with gastric cancer (GC). Pathomics, which is based on the development of digital pathology, is an emerging field that might improve clinical management. Herein, we propose a pathomics signature (PSGC) that is derived from multiple pathomics features of haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. We find that the PSGC is an independent predictor of prognosis. A nomogram incorporating the PSGC and TNM staging system shows significantly improved accuracy in predicting the prognosis compared to the TNM staging system alone. Moreover, in stage II and III GC patients with a low PSGC (but not in those with a high PSGC), satisfactory chemotherapy benefits are observed. Therefore, the PSGC could serve as a prognostic predictor in patients with GC and might be a potential predictive indicator for decision-making regarding adjuvant chemotherapy.

AB  - The 21st Century Cures Act, approved in the USA in December 2016, has encouraged the establishment of the national Precision Medicine Initiative and the augmentation of efforts to address disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment on the basis of a molecular understanding of disease. The Act adopts into law the formal process, developed by the FDA, of qualification of drug development tools, including biomarkers and clinical outcome assessments, to increase the efficiency of clinical trials and encourage an era of molecular medicine. The FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have developed similar processes for the qualification of biomarkers intended for use as companion diagnostics or for development and regulatory approval of a drug or therapeutic. Biomarkers that are used exclusively for the diagnosis, monitoring or stratification of patients in clinical trials are not subject to regulatory approval, although their qualification can facilitate the conduct of a trial. In this Review, the salient features of biomarker discovery, analytical validation, clinical qualification and utilization are described in order to provide an understanding of the process of biomarker development and, through this understanding, convey an appreciation of their potential advantages and limitations.

AB  - We present Biomedisa, a free and easy-to-use open-source online platform developed for semi-automatic segmentation of large volumetric images. The segmentation is based on a smart interpolation of sparsely pre-segmented slices taking into account the complete underlying image data. Biomedisa is particularly valuable when little a priori knowledge is available, e.g. for the dense annotation of the training data for a deep neural network. The platform is accessible through a web browser and requires no complex and tedious configuration of software and model parameters, thus addressing the needs of scientists without substantial computational expertise. We demonstrate that Biomedisa can drastically reduce both the time and human effort required to segment large images. It achieves a significant improvement over the conventional approach of densely pre-segmented slices with subsequent morphological interpolation as well as compared to segmentation tools that also consider the underlying image data. Biomedisa can be used for different 3D imaging modalities and various biomedical applications.

AB  - Technology in microscopy advances rapidly, enabling increasingly affordable, faster, and more precise quantitative biomedical imaging, which necessitates correspondingly more-advanced image processing and analysis techniques. A wide range of software is available-from commercial to academic, special-purpose to Swiss army knife, small to large-but a key characteristic of software that is suitable for scientific inquiry is its accessibility. Open-source software is ideal for scientific endeavors because it can be freely inspected, modified, and redistributed; in particular, the open-software platform ImageJ has had a huge impact on the life sciences, and continues to do so. From its inception, ImageJ has grown significantly due largely to being freely available and its vibrant and helpful user community. Scientists as diverse as interested hobbyists, technical assistants, students, scientific staff, and advanced biology researchers use ImageJ on a daily basis, and exchange knowledge via its dedicated mailing list. Uses of ImageJ range from data visualization and teaching to advanced image processing and statistical analysis. The software's extensibility continues to attract biologists at all career stages as well as computer scientists who wish to effectively implement specific image-processing algorithms. In this review, we use the ImageJ project as a case study of how open-source software fosters its suites of software tools, making multitudes of image-analysis technology easily accessible to the scientific community. We specifically explore what makes ImageJ so popular, how it impacts the life sciences, how it inspires other projects, and how it is self-influenced by coevolving projects within the ImageJ ecosystem.

AB  - For decades, biologists have relied on software to visualize and interpret imaging data. As techniques for acquiring images increase in complexity, resulting in larger multidimensional datasets, imaging software must adapt. ImageJ is an open‚Äêsource image analysis software platform that has aided researchers with a variety of image analysis applications, driven mainly by engaged and collaborative user and developer communities. The close collaboration between programmers and users has resulted in adaptations to accommodate new challenges in image analysis that address the needs of ImageJ's diverse user base. ImageJ consists of many components, some relevant primarily for developers and a vast collection of user‚Äêcentric plugins. It is available in many forms, including the widely used Fiji distribution. We refer to this entire ImageJ codebase and community as the ImageJ ecosystem. Here we review the core features of this ecosystem and highlight how ImageJ has responded to imaging technology advancements with new plugins and tools in recent years. These plugins and tools have been developed to address user needs in several areas such as visualization, segmentation, and tracking of biological entities in large, complex datasets. Moreover, new capabilities for deep learning are being added to ImageJ, reflecting a shift in the bioimage analysis community towards exploiting artificial intelligence. These new tools have been facilitated by profound architectural changes to the ImageJ core brought about by the ImageJ2 project. Therefore, we also discuss the contributions of ImageJ2 to enhancing multidimensional image processing and interoperability in the ImageJ ecosystem., ImageJ is an open‚Äêsource image analysis software with a large, diverse user base. ImageJ has several components and distributions such that we refer to the entirety as the ImageJ ecosystem. Recent developments have adapted to the needs of users and the demands of increasingly large, complex biological datasets accompanying technological advancements in imaging. This review highlights several new tools developed in the ImageJ ecosystem to address needs for improved visualization and analysis of biological features.

AB  - Light-sheet microscopy has emerged as the preferred means for high-throughput volumetric imaging of cleared tissues. However, there is a need for a flexible system that can address imaging applications with varied requirements in terms of resolution, sample size, tissue-clearing protocol, and transparent sample-holder material. Here, we present a ‚Äòhybrid‚Äô system that combines a unique non-orthogonal dual-objective and conventional (orthogonal) open-top light-sheet (OTLS) architecture for versatile multi-scale volumetric imaging. We demonstrate efficient screening and targeted sub-micrometer imaging of sparse axons within an intact, cleared mouse brain. The same system enables high-throughput automated imaging of multiple specimens, as spotlighted by a quantitative multi-scale analysis of brain metastases. Compared with existing academic and commercial light-sheet microscopy systems, our hybrid OTLS system provides a unique combination of versatility and performance necessary to satisfy the diverse requirements of a growing number of cleared-tissue imaging applications.

AB  - Imaging can potentially make a major contribution to the Zebrafish Phenome Project, which will probe the functions of vertebrate genes through the generation and phenotyping of mutants. Imaging of whole animals at different developmental stages through adulthood will be used to infer biological function. Cell resolutions will be required to identify cellular mechanism and to detect a full range of organ effects. Light-based imaging of live zebrafish embryos is practical only up to ‚àº2 days of development, owing to increasing pigmentation and diminishing tissue lucency with age. The small size of the zebrafish makes possible whole-animal imaging at cell resolutions by histology and micron-scale tomography (microCT). The histological study of larvae is facilitated by the use of arrays, and histology's standard use in the study of human disease enhances its translational value. Synchrotron microCT with X-rays of moderate energy (10-25 keV) is unimpeded by pigmentation or the tissue thicknesses encountered in zebrafish of larval stages and beyond, and is well-suited to detecting phenotypes that may require 3D modeling. The throughput required for this project will require robotic sample preparation and loading, increases in the dimensions and sensitivity of scintillator and CCD chips, increases in computer power, and the development of new approaches to image processing, segmentation, and quantification.

AB  - Biomedical research and clinical diagnosis would benefit greatly from full volume determinations of anatomical phenotype. Comprehensive tools for morphological phenotyping are central for the emerging field of phenomics, which requires high-throughput, systematic, accurate, and reproducible data collection from organisms affected by genetic, disease, or environmental variables. Theoretically, complete anatomical phenotyping requires the assessment of every cell type in the whole organism, but this ideal is presently untenable due to the lack of an unbiased 3D imaging method that allows histopathological assessment of any cell type despite optical opacity. Histopathology, the current clinical standard for diagnostic phenotyping, involves the microscopic study of tissue sections to assess qualitative aspects of tissue architecture, disease mechanisms, and physiological state. However, quantitative features of tissue architecture such as cellular composition and cell counting in tissue volumes can only be approximated due to characteristics of tissue sectioning, including incomplete sampling and the constraints of 2D imaging of 5 micron thick tissue slabs. We have used a small, vertebrate organism, the zebrafish, to test the potential of microCT for systematic macroscopic and microscopic morphological phenotyping. While cell resolution is routinely achieved using methods such as light sheet fluorescence microscopy and optical tomography, these methods do not provide the pancellular perspective characteristic of histology, and are constrained by the limited penetration of visible light through pigmented and opaque specimens, as characterizes zebrafish juveniles. Here, we provide an example of neuroanatomy that can be studied by microCT of stained soft tissue at 1.43 micron isotropic voxel resolution. We conclude that synchrotron microCT is a form of 3D imaging that may potentially be adopted towards more reproducible, large-scale, morphological phenotyping of optically opaque tissues. Further development of soft tissue microCT, visualization and quantitative tools will enhance its utility.

AU  - LaBonte, Tyler

AU  - Roberts, Scott A.
AB  - Deep learning has been successfully applied to the segmentation of 3D Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Establishing the credibility of these segmentations requires uncertainty quantification (UQ) to identify untrustworthy predictions. Recent UQ architectures include Monte Carlo dropout networks (MCDNs), which approximate deep Gaussian processes, and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which learn the distribution of the weight space. BNNs are advantageous over MCDNs for UQ but are thought to be computationally infeasible in high dimension, and neither architecture has produced interpretable geometric uncertainty maps. We propose a novel 3D Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN), the first deep learning method which generates statistically credible geometric uncertainty maps and scales for application to 3D data. We present experimental results on CT scans of graphite electrodes and laser-welded metals and show that our BCNN outperforms an MCDN in recent uncertainty metrics. The geometric uncertainty maps generated by our BCNN capture distributions of sigmoid values that are interpretable as confidence intervals, critical for applications that rely on deep learning for high-consequence decisions.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) has revolutionized the field of computer vision and image processing. In medical imaging, algorithmic solutions based on DL have been shown to achieve high performance on tasks that previously required medical experts. However, DL-based solutions for disease detection have been proposed without methods to quantify and control their uncertainty in a decision. In contrast, a physician knows whether she is uncertain about a case and will consult more experienced colleagues if needed. Here we evaluate drop-out based Bayesian uncertainty measures for DL in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) from fundus images and show that it captures uncertainty better than straightforward alternatives. Furthermore, we show that uncertainty informed decision referral can improve diagnostic performance. Experiments across different networks, tasks and datasets show robust generalization. Depending on network capacity and task/dataset difficulty, we surpass 85% sensitivity and 80% specificity as recommended by the NHS when referring 0‚àí20% of the most uncertain decisions for further inspection. We analyse causes of uncertainty by relating intuitions from 2D visualizations to the high-dimensional image space. While uncertainty is sensitive to clinically relevant cases, sensitivity to unfamiliar data samples is task dependent, but can be rendered more robust.

AB  - Image-based simulation, the use of 3D images to calculate physical quantities, relies on image segmentation for geometry creation. However, this process introduces image segmentation uncertainty because different segmentation tools (both manual and machine-learning-based) will each produce a unique and valid segmentation. First, we demonstrate that these variations propagate into the physics simulations, compromising the resulting physics quantities. Second, we propose a general framework for rapidly quantifying segmentation uncertainty. Through the creation and sampling of segmentation uncertainty probability maps, we systematically and objectively create uncertainty distributions of the physics quantities. We show that physics quantity uncertainty distributions can follow a Normal distribution, but, in more complicated physics simulations, the resulting uncertainty distribution can be surprisingly nontrivial. We establish that bounding segmentation uncertainty can fail in these nontrivial situations. While our work does not eliminate segmentation uncertainty, it improves simulation credibility by making visible the previously unrecognized segmentation uncertainty plaguing image-based simulation.

AB  - Pathologic examination of prostate biopsies is time consuming due to the large number of slides per case. In this retrospective study, we validate a deep learning-based classifier for prostate cancer (PCA) detection and Gleason grading (AI tool) in biopsy samples. Five external cohorts of patients with multifocal prostate biopsy were analyzed from high-volume pathology institutes. A total of 5922 H&E sections representing 7473 biopsy cores from 423 patient cases (digitized using three scanners) were assessed concerning tumor detection. Two tumor-bearing datasets (core n‚Äâ=‚Äâ227 and 159) were graded by an international group of pathologists including expert urologic pathologists (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ11) to validate the Gleason grading classifier. The sensitivity, specificity, and NPV for the detection of tumor-bearing biopsies was in a range of 0.971‚Äì1.000, 0.875‚Äì0.976, and 0.988‚Äì1.000, respectively, across the different test cohorts. In several biopsy slides tumor tissue was correctly detected by the AI tool that was initially missed by pathologists. Most false positive misclassifications represented lesions suspicious for carcinoma or cancer mimickers. The quadratically weighted kappa levels for Gleason grading agreement for single pathologists was 0.62‚Äì0.80 (0.77 for AI tool) and 0.64‚Äì0.76 (0.72 for AI tool) for the two grading datasets, respectively. In cases where consensus for grading was reached among pathologists, kappa levels for AI tool were 0.903 and 0.855. The PCA detection classifier showed high accuracy for PCA detection in biopsy cases during external validation, independent of the institute and scanner used. High levels of agreement for Gleason grading were indistinguishable between experienced genitourinary pathologists and the AI tool.

AB  - Simple Summary
Prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in men worldwide, with an estimated 1,276,000 new cases and 359,000 deaths in 2018. It is graded using the Gleason system into five grade groups of increasing tumor aggressiveness. However, diagnosis is hampered by a relatively high rate of inter- and intra-observer variability. Currently, the reduction of the perceived color variability is performed by physical quality controls, such as subjective assessment by visual inspection and comparison between laboratories. However, slides from different laboratories and even from different batches of the same laboratory may show significant color variations. The stain normalization procedure helps to standardize the stain color appearance of a digital image with respect to a reference image. In this study, we investigated the impact of the stain normalization process on prostate cancer biopsies from the pathologist‚Äôs perspective.

Abstract
In clinical routine, the quality of whole-slide images plays a key role in the pathologist‚Äôs diagnosis, and suboptimal staining may be a limiting factor. The stain normalization process helps to solve this problem through the standardization of color appearance of a source image with respect to a target image with optimal chromatic features. The analysis is focused on the evaluation of the following parameters assessed by two experts on original and normalized slides: (i) perceived color quality, (ii) diagnosis for the patient, (iii) diagnostic confidence and (iv) time required for diagnosis. Results show a statistically significant increase in color quality in the normalized images for both experts (p < 0.0001). Regarding prostate cancer assessment, the average times for diagnosis are significantly lower for normalized images than original ones (first expert: 69.9 s vs. 77.9 s with p < 0.0001; second expert: 37.4 s vs. 52.7 s with p < 0.0001), and at the same time, a statistically significant increase in diagnostic confidence is proven. The improvement of poor-quality images and greater clarity of diagnostically important details in normalized slides demonstrate the potential of stain normalization in the routine practice of prostate cancer assessment.

AB  - CONTEXT: Gleason grading is now the sole prostatic carcinoma grading system recommended by the World Health Organization. It is imperative that there be good interobserver reproducibility within this system worldwide. To our knowledge, there are no studies, using the same specimens, that compare the interobserver reproducibility of Gleason grading in Japan and the United States.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the interobserver reproducibility of Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma in Japan and the United States using, in Japan, images from the identical biopsy glass slides that were originally graded in the United States.
DESIGN: Microsopic images from 37 needle biopsies of prostatic carcinoma were placed on CD-ROM and distributed to 14 Japanese pathologists for grading. These 14 physicians included 8 general pathologists and 6 pathologists with a special interest in urologic pathology. The needle biopsies had been previously reviewed so that a consensus diagnosis could be formed by a panel of urologic pathologists in the United States and Canada. Interobserver agreement with the consensus diagnoses was calculated by determining the overall kappa coefficient for the Japanese pathologists and then compared to the interobserver agreement among American general pathologists who had previously graded identical needle biopsies from which the CD-ROM images had been taken.
RESULTS: The interobserver agreement with the consensus diagnoses for the 4 Gleason grading groups (Gleason grades 2-4, 5-6, 7, and 8-10) among the Japanese urologic pathologists in this series of cases was substantial (overall kappa = 0.68), and for the Japanese general pathologists, it was moderate (overall kappa = 0.49), similar to that reported in the earlier study of American general pathologists (overall kappa = 0.44). The major interobserver reproducibility problem for both Japanese and American general pathologists is undergrading. The major areas of undergrading are the underdiagnosis of Gleason scores 5-6 as Gleason scores 2-4, and the underdiagnosis of cribriform sheets and fragments of cribriform Gleason pattern 4 carcinoma as Gleason pattern 3.
CONCLUSIONS: The interobserver reproducibility of the Gleason grading for this collection of specimens was similar among Japanese and American general pathologists. The overall kappa values for these generalists of 0.44 and 0.49 are only in the moderate (0.41-0.60) range of interobserver agreement when compared to 0.68, substantial (0.61-0.80) agreement, for Japanese urologic pathologists. Educational efforts to improve Gleason grading have been shown to be effective and are clearly warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the reproducibility of the Gleason grading system and to compare its interobserver variability with the novel Gleason grade grouping proposal using a large sample volume.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 407 pathology slides of prostate needle biopsies from 34 consecutive patients with prostate cancer were re-evaluated. The International Society of Urological Pathology 2005 modified Gleason grading system with Epstein's modification was used. Two pathologists, blind to each other and to the initial pathology report, performed the pathological evaluation. To determine interobserver concordance, the kappa (Œ∫) coefficient test was used.
RESULTS: Pathologist 1 and pathologist 2 detected a tumor in 202 and 231 cores, respectively (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). The two pathologists disagreed on the presence of a tumor in 31 cores. Of these 31 cores, 74% (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ23/31) were Gleason pattern 3. The mean length of the cancer foci in these 31 disputed cores was 1.54‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.8‚ÄÖmm. Concordance rates between the two observers for primary and secondary Gleason patterns were 63.96% (Œ∫‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.34) and 63.45% (Œ∫‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.37), respectively. Concordance with respect to the Gleason sum was 57.9% (Œ∫‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.43). When the Gleason scores were classified into the novel Gleason grade grouping, concordance was found to be 51.7% (Œ∫‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.39).
CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between observers on the Gleason sum was moderate. The novel Gleason grade grouping did not improve interobserver agreement. Further studies are needed to confirm these results on interobserver variability.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) prognostication largely relies upon visual assessment of a few thinly sectioned biopsy specimens under a microscope to assign a Gleason Grade Group (GG). Unfortunately, the assigned GG is not always associated with a patient's outcome, in part due to the limited sampling of spatially heterogeneous tumors achieved by 2D histopathology. In this study, open-top light sheet (OTLS) microscopy was used to obtain 3D pathology datasets that were assessed by four human readers. Intra-biopsy variability was assessed by asking readers to perform Gleason grading of 5 different levels per biopsy for a total of 20 core-needle biopsies (i.e., 100 total images). Intra-biopsy variability (Cohen's kappa) was calculated as the worst pairwise agreement in GG between individual levels within each biopsy, and was found to be 0.34, 0.34, 0.38, and 0.43 for the four pathologists. These preliminary results reveal that even within a 1-mm diameter needle core, GG based on 2D images can vary dramatically depending upon the location within a biopsy being analyzed. We believe that morphological assessment of whole biopsies in 3D has the potential to enable more reliable and consistent tumor grading.

AB  - Rapid histological assessment of large areas of prostate tissue is required for many intraoperative consultation scenarios such as margin evaluation. Nonlinear microscopy¬†(NLM) enables imaging of large (whole mount) specimens without freezing or cryotoming. This study demonstrates rapid histological imaging of unsectioned prostate cancer surgical specimens using nonlinear microscopy and compares features of prostate pathology to standard paraffin embedded H&E histology. Fresh or formalin fixed specimens were stained in 2.5‚Äâmin with fluorescent nuclear and stromal dyes. Nonlinear microscopy images of unsectioned tissues were generated by nonlinear (two-photon) excitation of the fluorophores, where fluorescence is only emitted from tissue at the microscope focus, avoiding the need for physical sectioning. The images were displayed in real time using a color scale similar to H&E, then tissues were processed for standard paraffin embedded H&E histology. Seventy nonlinear microscopy and corresponding paraffin H&E images of fresh and fixed prostate specimens (15 cancer, 55 benign) from 24 patients were read by genitourinary pathologists to assess if nonlinear microscopy could achieve an equivalent evaluation to paraffin embedded H&E histology. Differences between nonlinear microscopy images and paraffin H&E slides, including cytoplasmic color and stromal density, were observed, however nonlinear microscopy images could be interpreted with minimal training. Nonlinear microscopy enabled visualization of benign, atrophic and hyperplastic glands and stroma, ejaculatory ducts, vasculature and inflammatory changes. Nonlinear microscopy enabled identification of typical and variants of adenocarcinoma, as well as Gleason patterns. Perineural invasion and extraprostatic extension could also be assessed. Nonlinear microscopy images closely resemble paraffin H&E slides and enable rapid assessment of normal prostate architecture, benign conditions, and carcinoma in freshly excised and fixed specimens. Nonlinear microscopy can image large regions of tissue, equivalent to multiple frozen section tissue blocks, within minutes because cryotoming/microtoming are not required, making it a promising technique for intraoperative consultation.

AB  - Prostate cancer treatment planning is largely dependent upon examination of core-needle biopsies. The microscopic architecture of the prostate glands forms the basis for prognostic grading by pathologists. Interpretation of these convoluted three-dimensional (3D) glandular structures via visual inspection of a limited number of two-dimensional (2D) histology sections is often unreliable, which contributes to the under- and overtreatment of patients. To improve risk assessment and treatment decisions, we have developed a workflow for nondestructive 3D pathology and computational analysis of whole prostate biopsies labeled with a rapid and inexpensive fluorescent analogue of standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. This analysis is based on interpretable glandular features and is facilitated by the development of image translation-assisted segmentation in 3D (ITAS3D). ITAS3D is a generalizable deep learning-based strategy that enables tissue microstructures to be volumetrically segmented in an annotation-free and objective (biomarker-based) manner without requiring immunolabeling. As a preliminary demonstration of the translational value of a computational 3D versus a computational 2D pathology approach, we imaged 300 ex vivo biopsies extracted from 50 archived radical prostatectomy specimens, of which, 118 biopsies contained cancer. The 3D glandular features in cancer biopsies were superior to corresponding 2D features for risk stratification of patients with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer based on their clinical biochemical recurrence outcomes. The results of this study support the use of computational 3D pathology for guiding the clinical management of prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: An end-to-end pipeline for deep learning-assisted computational 3D histology analysis of whole prostate biopsies shows that nondestructive 3D pathology has the potential to enable superior prognostic stratification of patients with prostate cancer.

AB  - CONTEXT.‚Äî: Ex vivo microscopy encompasses a range of techniques to examine fresh or fixed tissue with microscopic resolution, eliminating the need to embed the tissue in paraffin or produce a glass slide. One such technique is light-sheet microscopy, which enables rapid 3D imaging. Our pathology-engineering collaboration has resulted in an open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscope that is specifically tailored to the needs of pathology practice.
OBJECTIVE.‚Äî: To present an image atlas of OTLS images of prostate core needle biopsies.
DESIGN.‚Äî: Core needle biopsies (N = 9) were obtained from fresh radical prostatectomy specimens. Each biopsy was fixed in formalin, dehydrated in ethanol, stained with TO-PRO3 and eosin, optically cleared, and imaged using OTLS microscopy. The biopsies were then processed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. Hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin 5 and cytokeratin 8 was performed.
RESULTS.‚Äî: Benign and neoplastic histologic structures showed high fidelity between OTLS and traditional light microscopy. OTLS microscopy had no discernible effect on hematoxylin-eosin or immunohistochemical staining in this pilot study. The 3D histology information obtained using OTLS microscopy enabled new structural insights, including the observation of cribriform and well-formed gland morphologies within the same contiguous glandular structures, as well as the continuity of poorly formed glands with well-formed glands.
CONCLUSIONS.‚Äî: Three-dimensional OTLS microscopy images have a similar appearance to traditional hematoxylin-eosin histology images, with the added benefit of useful 3D structural information. Further studies are needed to continue to document the OTLS appearance of a wide range of tissues and to better understand 3D histologic structures.

Patients with localized disease at a low to intermediate risk of recurrence generally have a favourable outcome of 99% overall survival for 10 years if the disease is detected and treated at an early stage. Key genetic alterations include fusions of TMPRSS2 with ETS family genes, amplification of the MYC oncogene, deletion and/or mutation of PTEN and TP53 and, in advanced disease, amplification and/or mutation of the androgen receptor (AR). Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed by prostate biopsy prompted by a blood test to measure prostate-specific antigen levels and/or digital rectal examination. Treatment for localized disease includes active surveillance, radical prostatectomy or ablative radiotherapy as curative approaches. Men whose disease relapses after prostatectomy are treated with salvage radiotherapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for local relapse, or with ADT combined with chemotherapy or novel androgen signalling-targeted agents for systemic relapse. Advanced prostate cancer often progresses despite androgen ablation and is then considered castration-resistant and incurable. Current treatment options include AR-targeted agents, chemotherapy, radionuclides and the poly(ADP-ribose) inhibitor olaparib. Current research aims to improve prostate cancer detection, management and outcomes, including understanding the fundamental biology at all stages of the disease.

AB  - In oncology, intratumoural heterogeneity is closely linked with the efficacy of therapy, and can be partially characterized via tumour biopsies. Here we show that intratumoural heterogeneity can be characterized spatially via phenotype-specific, multi-view learning classifiers trained with data from dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Classifiers trained with PET‚ÄìMRI data from mice with subcutaneous colon cancer quantified phenotypic changes resulting from an apoptosis-inducing targeted therapeutic and provided biologically relevant probability maps of tumour-tissue subtypes. When applied to retrospective PET‚ÄìMRI data of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer, the trained classifiers characterized intratumoural tissue subregions in agreement with tumour histology. The spatial characterization of intratumoural heterogeneity in mice and patients via multimodal, multiparametric imaging aided by machine-learning may facilitate applications in precision oncology.

AB  - In recent years, technological advances in tissue preparation, high-throughput volumetric microscopy, and computational infrastructure have enabled rapid developments in nondestructive 3D pathology, in which high-resolution histologic datasets are obtained from thick tissue specimens, such as whole biopsies, without the need for physical sectioning onto glass slides. While 3D pathology generates massive datasets that are attractive for automated computational analysis, there is also a desire to use 3D pathology to improve the visual assessment of tissue histology. In this perspective, we discuss and provide examples of potential advantages of 3D pathology for the visual assessment of clinical specimens and the challenges of dealing with large 3D datasets (of individual or multiple specimens) that pathologists have not been trained to interpret. We discuss the need for artificial intelligence triaging algorithms and explainable analysis methods to assist pathologists or other domain experts in the interpretation of these novel, often complex, large datasets.

However, very few studies have been focused on the actual physics/chemistry aspect of process of this fixation. This article attempts to explain the chemistry of formaldehyde fixation and also to study the physical aspects involved in the fixation. The factors involved in the fixation process are discussed using well documented mathematical and physical formulae. The deeper understanding of these factors will enable pathologist to optimize the factors and use them in their favor.

AB  - Here, we describe a novel approach that allows pathologists to three-dimensionally analyse malignant tissues, including the tumour-host tissue interface. Our visualization technique utilizes a combination of ultrafast chemical tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy to obtain virtual slices and 3D reconstructions of up to multiple centimetre sized tumour resectates. For the clearing of tumours we propose a preparation technique comprising three steps: (a) Fixation and enhancement of tissue autofluorescence with formalin/5-sulfosalicylic acid. (b) Ultrafast active chemical dehydration with 2,2-dimethoxypropane and (c) refractive index matching with dibenzyl ether at up to 56¬†¬∞C. After clearing, the tumour resectates are imaged. The images are computationally post-processed for contrast enhancement and artefact removal and then 3D reconstructed. Importantly, the sequence a‚Äìc is fully reversible, allowing the morphological correlation of one and the same histological structures, once visualized with our novel technique and once visualized by standard H&E- and IHC-staining. After reverting the clearing procedure followed by standard H&E processing, the hallmarks of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) found in the cleared samples could be successfully correlated with the corresponding structures present in H&E and IHC staining. Since the imaging of several thousands of optical sections is a fast process, it is possible to analyse a larger part of the tumour than by mechanical slicing. As this also adds further information about the 3D structure of malignancies, we expect that our technology will become a valuable addition for histological diagnosis in clinical pathology.

AB  - Tissue clearing of gross anatomical samples was first described over a century ago and has only recently found widespread use in the field of microscopy. This renaissance has been driven by the application of modern knowledge of optical physics and chemical engineering to the development of robust and reproducible clearing techniques, the arrival of new microscopes that can image large samples at cellular resolution and computing infrastructure able to store and analyze large data volumes. Many biological relationships between structure and function require investigation in three dimensions and tissue clearing therefore has the potential to enable broad discoveries in the biological sciences. Unfortunately, the current literature is complex and could confuse researchers looking to begin a clearing project. The goal of this Primer is to outline a modular approach to tissue clearing that allows a novice researcher to develop a customized clearing pipeline tailored to their tissue of interest. Further, the Primer outlines the required imaging and computational infrastructure needed to perform tissue clearing at scale, gives an overview of current applications, discusses limitations and provides an outlook on future advances in the field.

AB  - With the recent explosion in the amount, the variety, and the dimensionality of available data, identifying, extracting, and exploiting their underlying structure has become a problem of fundamental importance for data analysis and statistical learning. Topological data analysis (tda) is a recent and fast-growing field providing a set of new topological and geometric tools to infer relevant features for possibly complex data. It proposes new well-founded mathematical theories and computational tools that can be used independently or in combination with other data analysis and statistical learning techniques. This article is a brief introduction, through a few selected topics, to basic fundamental and practical aspects of tda for nonexperts.

AB  - Tissue phenotyping is foundational to understanding and assessing the cellular aspects of disease in organismal context and an important adjunct to molecular studies in the dissection of gene function, chemical effects, and disease. As a first step toward computational tissue phenotyping, we explore the potential of cellular phenotyping from 3-Dimensional (3D), 0.74 ¬µm isotropic voxel resolution, whole zebrafish larval images derived from X-ray histotomography, a form of micro-CT customized for histopathology. As proof of principle towards computational tissue phenotyping of cells, we created a semi-automated mechanism for the segmentation of blood cells in the vascular spaces of zebrafish larvae, followed by modeling and extraction of quantitative geometric parameters. Manually segmented cells were used to train a random forest classifier for blood cells, enabling the use of a generalized cellular segmentation algorithm for the accurate segmentation of blood cells. These models were used to create an automated data segmentation and analysis pipeline to guide the steps in a 3D workflow including blood cell region prediction, cell boundary extraction, and statistical characterization of 3D geometric and cytological features. We were able to distinguish blood cells at two stages in development (4- and 5-days-post-fertilization) and wild-type vs. polA2 huli hutu (hht) mutants. The application of geometric modeling across cell types to and across organisms and sample types may comprise a valuable foundation for computational phenotyping that is more open, informative, rapid, objective, and reproducible.

AB  - Human tissue, which is inherently three-dimensional (3D), is traditionally examined through standard-of-care histopathology as limited two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections that can insufficiently represent the tissue due to sampling bias. To holistically characterize histomorphology, 3D imaging modalities have been developed, but clinical translation is hampered by complex manual evaluation and lack of computational platforms to distill clinical insights from large, high-resolution datasets. We present TriPath, a deep-learning platform for processing tissue volumes and efficiently predicting clinical outcomes based on 3D morphological features. Recurrence risk-stratification models were trained on prostate cancer specimens imaged with open-top light-sheet microscopy or microcomputed tomography. By comprehensively capturing 3D morphologies, 3D volume-based prognostication achieves superior performance to traditional 2D slice-based approaches, including clinical/histopathological baselines from six certified genitourinary pathologists. Incorporating greater tissue volume improves prognostic performance and mitigates risk prediction variability from sampling bias, further emphasizing the value of capturing larger extents of heterogeneous morphology.

AB  - Spatial transcriptomics measures in situ gene expression at millions of locations within a tissue1, hitherto with some trade-off between transcriptome depth, spatial resolution and sample size2. Although integration of image-based segmentation has enabled impactful work in this context, it is limited by imaging quality and tissue heterogeneity. By contrast, recent array-based technologies offer the ability to measure the entire transcriptome at subcellular resolution across large samples3‚Äì6. Presently, there exist no approaches for cell type identification that directly leverage this information to annotate individual cells. Here we propose a multiscale approach to automatically classify cell types at this subcellular level, using both transcriptomic information and spatial context. We showcase this on both targeted and whole-transcriptome spatial platforms, improving cell classification and morphology for human kidney tissue and pinpointing individual sparsely distributed renal mouse immune cells without reliance on image data. By integrating these predictions into a topological pipeline based on multiparameter persistent homology7‚Äì9, we identify cell spatial relationships characteristic of a mouse model of lupus nephritis, which we validate experimentally by immunofluorescence. The proposed framework readily generalizes to new platforms, providing a comprehensive pipeline bridging different levels of biological organization from genes through to tissues.

AB  - Micro-CT imaging is a powerful tool for generating high resolution, isotropic three-dimensional datasets of whole, centimeter-scale model organisms that can be used for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The small size, global freshwater distribution, wide range of cell size and structures of micron scale, and common use of D. magna in toxicological and environmental studies make it an ideal model for demonstrating the potential power of micro-CT-enabled whole-organism phenotyping. This protocol details the steps involved in D. magna samples preparation for micro-CT: euthanasia, fixation, staining, and resin embedding. Micro-CT reconstructions of samples imaged using synchrotron micro-CT reveal histological (microanatomic) features of organ systems, tissues, and cells in the context of the entire organism at sub-micron resolution, and in 3 dimensionality. The enabled ‚Äú3D histology‚Äù and 3D renderings can be used towards morphometric analyses across cells, tissues, and organ systems for both descriptive and hypothesis testing studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Topological persistence is a powerful and general technique for characterizing the geometry and topology of data. Its theoretical foundations are over 15 years old and efficient computational algorithms are now available for the analysis of large digital images. We explain here how quantities derived from topological persistence relate to other measurements on porous materials such as grain and pore-size distributions, connectivity numbers, and the critical radius of a percolating sphere. The connections between percolation and topological persistence are explored in detail using data obtained from micro-CT images of spherical bead packings, unconsolidated sand packing, a variety of sandstones, and a limestone. We demonstrate how persistence information can be used to estimate the percolating sphere radius and to characterize the connectivity of the percolating cluster.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH), defined by a mean pulmonary arterial blood pressure above 20 mmHg in the main pulmonary artery, is a cardiovascular disease impacting the pulmonary vasculature. PH is accompanied by chronic vascular remodeling, wherein vessels become stiffer, large vessels dilate, and smaller vessels constrict. Some types of PH, including hypoxia-induced PH (HPH), also lead to microvascular rarefaction. This study analyzes the change in pulmonary arterial morphometry in the presence of HPH using novel methods from topological data analysis (TDA). We employ persistent homology to quantify arterial morphometry for control and HPH mice characterizing normalized arterial trees extracted from micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images. We normalize generated trees using three pruning algorithms before comparing the topology of control and HPH trees. This proof-of-concept study shows that the pruning method affects the spatial tree statistics and complexity. We find that HPH trees are stiffer than control trees but have more branches and a higher depth. Relative directional complexities are lower in HPH animals in the right, ventral, and posterior directions. For the radius pruned trees, this difference is more significant at lower perfusion pressures enabling analysis of remodeling of larger vessels. At higher pressures, the arterial networks include more distal vessels. Results show that the right, ventral, and posterior relative directional complexities increase in HPH trees, indicating the remodeling of distal vessels in these directions. Strahler order pruning enables us to generate trees of comparable size, and results, at all pressure, show that HPH trees have lower complexity than the control trees. Our analysis is based on data from 6 animals (3 control and 3 HPH mice), and even though our analysis is performed in a small dataset, this study provides a framework and proof-of-concept for analyzing properties of biological trees using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). Findings derived from this study bring us a step closer to extracting relevant information for quantifying remodeling in HPH.

AB  - Advances in laboratory-based X-ray computed tomography (CT) have enabled X-ray 3D virtual histology. This method shows a great potential as a complementary technique to conventional 2D histology where extensive volumetric sampling is necessary. While formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks are the backbone of clinical histology, there exists no generic optimization, and technical study of the X-ray 3D virtual histology of FFPE blocks. X-ray micro-CT of FFPE blocks is studied and optimized in their native state within the cassette to minimize the interference of X-ray 3D virtual histology with clinical workflows and standards, hence facilitating the technology transfer to the clinics. The optimization is carried on the sample positioning, tungsten tubes acceleration voltage, and artifact reduction. Then propagation-based imaging of FFPE blocks is extensively discussed. Hierarchical (local) tomography and laminography are presented as viable approaches for achieving higher spatial resolutions. In the end, future perspectives are given by considering state-of-the-art micro-CT scanners using liquid-metal-jet sources, large-area detectors, and photon counting detectors. The results achieved here are generic and can be applicable to any laboratory-based scanner with a tungsten target source and cone-beam geometry. This article provides a starting point for anyone new to X-ray 3D virtual histology on FFPE blocks, but also serves as a useful source for more experienced users.

AB  - Histological analysis is the core of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) classification. The histopathological criteria of capsular and vascular invasion define malignancy and aggressiveness of FTC. Analysis of multiple sections is cumbersome and as only a minute tissue fraction is analyzed during histopathology, under-sampling remains a problem. Application of an efficient tool for complete tissue imaging in 3D would speed-up diagnosis and increase accuracy. We show that X-ray propagation-based imaging (XPBI) of paraffin-embedded tissue blocks is a valuable complementary method for follicular thyroid carcinoma diagnosis and assessment. It enables a fast, non-destructive and accurate 3D virtual histology of the FTC resection specimen. We demonstrate that XPBI virtual slices can reliably evaluate capsular invasions. Then we discuss the accessible morphological information from XPBI and their significance for vascular invasion diagnosis. We show 3D morphological information that allow to discern vascular invasions. The results are validated by comparing XPBI images with clinically accepted histology slides revised by and under supervision of two experienced endocrine pathologists.

AB  - X-ray phase contrast tomography (XPCT) is widely used for 3D imaging of objects with weak contrast in X-ray absorption index but strong contrast in refractive index decrement. To reconstruct an object imaged using XPCT, phase retrieval algorithms are first used to estimate the X-ray phase projections, which is the 2D projection of the refractive index decrement, at each view. Phase retrieval is followed by refractive index decrement reconstruction from the phase projections using an algorithm such as filtered back projection (FBP). In practice, phase retrieval is most commonly solved by approximating it as a linear inverse problem. However, this linear approximation often results in artifacts and blurring when the conditions for the approximation are violated. In this paper, we formulate phase retrieval as a non-linear inverse problem, where we solve for the transmission function, which is the negative exponential of the projections, from XPCT measurements. We use a constraint to enforce proportionality between phase and absorption projections. We do not use constraints such as large Fresnel number, slowly varying phase, or Born/Rytov approximations. Our approach also does not require any regularization parameter tuning since there is no explicit sparsity enforcing regularization function. We validate the performance of our non-linear phase retrieval (NLPR) method using both simulated and real synchrotron datasets. We compare NLPR with a popular linear phase retrieval (LPR) approach and show that NLPR achieves sharper reconstructions with higher quantitative accuracy.
