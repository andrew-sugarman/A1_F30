\part*{Project Narrative}
Cancer diagnosis relies on the assessment of cell and tissue morphology from histology, but methods to quantify these features are limited due to the 2-dimensional output of current histopathological techniques. This project aims to address these shortcomings by developing imaging and analytical approaches to perform 3D histopathology of soft tissue biopsies, with an emphasis on prostate cancer. We propose that this will yield unbiased visualization and measurement of tumor architecture otherwise inaccessible to traditional histopathology.
